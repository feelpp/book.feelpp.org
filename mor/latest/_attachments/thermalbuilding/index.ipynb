Internal walls and doors are modelled as having finite thickness, while external walls properties (thickness and insulation) are encoded in the boundary conditions of the problem.\n","## Mathematical model\n\n","Let $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ be the region occupied by the building, and denote $\\Omega_i$, $i=0,1,2$ its subregions occupied by the air, the internal walls and the internal doors, such that $\\Omega = \\cup_{i=0}^2 \\Omega_i$. Let $k_i$ be the thermal conductivities associated with the subregions.\n","The external boundary of the domain $\\partial \\Omega$ is decomposed into two parts: $\\partial \\Omega_{ext}$, which corresponds to external walls, and $\\partial \\Omega_D$ which corresponds to the front door. We denote by $\\Gamma_i$ the boundary of the $i-$th heating unit, $i=0,...,4$. The problem writes as\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n- \\nabla \\cdot (k_i\\nabla u) &= 0, \\quad &\\text{on }\\Omega_i \\\\\nu &= \\mu_i \\quad &\\text{on }\\Gamma_i, i=0,...,4, \\\\\n-  k_0 \\nabla u \\cdot \\vec{n} &= \\mu_6 (u - \\mu_5), \\quad &\\text{on }\\partial \\Omega_{ext},\\\\\n-  k_0 \\nabla u \\cdot \\vec{n} &= \\sigma (u - \\mu_5), \\quad &\\text{on }\\partial \\Omega_{D}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n","where $\\sigma$ is the convective heat exchange coefficient associated with the front door.\n","The parameters $\\mu_i$ correspond to\n","\n","- $\\mu_i \\in (300,340)$, for $i=0,...,4$, are the surface temperatures of the heating units (in Kelvin);\n","- $\\mu_5 \\in (270,290)$ is the external temperature (in Kelvin);\n","- $\\mu_6$ is a function of the external wall thickness.
