The proper ressources cluster of the 
link:http://irma.math.unistra.fr/[Research Institute Advanced Mathematics (IRMA - UMR7501)].

<<<

== Prerequisites

* You have to own an account on the machine. External user can ask for an account
if they are related to an institute research project.
* To learn how to use the cluster, we recommend reading the
link:https://gitlab.math.unistra.fr/atlas/cluster-doc/wikis/home[official documentation]
* To use differents libraries version that match your need, the cluster uses link:http://modules.sourceforge.net/[environment modules]
You should familiarize first to know how to load specific softwares.
* The cluster use link:https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html[slurm] job supervisor.
You should be familiar with job creation and job submission before going further.

TIP: We provide on the cluster Feel++ profile modules which loads all Feel++ dependencies
and that are guaranty to works!
you can type `module avail 2>&1 | grep profile` to list all profiles.

== Feel++ usage

WARNING: Work in progress

In this section, we will learn basic usage of Feel++ on the cluster. We
distinguish two cases, the first one uses the existing Feel++ module. You might
want to modify the Feel++ library itself, the second case will explain how to
proceed.

=== Feel++ configuration

The cluster mount points with different filesystems with more or less fast read/write
operations.

=== Feel++ atlas quickstart

==== Use Feel++ module

This way is recommended if you only need to use the {feelpp} library
without any modification.
Currently, a {feelpp} module is provided for a nightly build version.

1. Load the feel++ library module.

[source,sh]
----
module load science/feelpp/nightly
----

2. Load a feel++ profile to have access to all {feelpp} requirements for compiling
your application.

[source,sh]
----
module load feelpp-clang_gcc610.profile
----

NOTE: The profile should be the same used for the feel++ module to avoid
mismatch setup for the compilation

TIP: From here you can go to Quickstart section.

3. Place yourself in a directory and create a cmake file named
`CMakeLists.txt` containing the following code.

[source,cmake,linenums]
----
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)

find_package(Feel++
  PATHS $ENV{FEELPP_DIR}/share/feel/cmake/modules
  /usr/share/feel/cmake/modules
  /usr/local/share/feel/cmake/modules
  /opt/share/feel/cmake/modules
  )
if(NOT FEELPP_FOUND)
  message(FATAL_ERROR "Feel++ was not found on your system. Make sure to install it and specify the FEELPP_DIR to reference the installation directory.")
endif()

feelpp_add_application(youApplication SRCS yourCode.cpp)
----

This file describes to cmake how to find the Feel++ library in the given directories.
By default, cmake will search in the system default path.


4. Create a C++ file named `yourCode.cpp`  where you will write your first Feel++ code.

5. Generate the Makefiles with cmake or using the configure script.
`/path/to/feelpp-sources/configure`

6. Compile you {feelpp} application `make`


==== Recompile Feel++
