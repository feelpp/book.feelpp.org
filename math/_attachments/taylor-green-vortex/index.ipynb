The problem can be solved for different values of the diffusion coefficient $\\mu$.\n\n","## Advection-diffusion with Taylor-Green Vortex\n\n","The problem is defined on the spatial domain $\\Omega = (-1, 1)^2$ with Dirichlet boundary $\\Gamma_D := (-1, 1) \\times \\{-1\\}$ and Neumann boundary $\\Gamma_N := \\partial\\Omega \\setminus \\Gamma_D$. The governing parametric PDE (pPDE) can be described as follows:\n","\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n    &\\partial_t c - \\mu\\Delta c + \\beta \\cdot \\nabla c = 0 &&\\text{in } \\Omega \\times (0, T), \\\\\n    &\\nabla c(x, t; \\mu) \\cdot n = 0 &&\\text{on } \\Gamma_N \\times (0, T), \\\\\n    &c(x, t; \\mu) = 0 &&\\text{on } \\Gamma_D \\times (0, T), \\\\\n    &c(x, 0; \\mu) = c_0(x; \\mu) &&\\text{in } \\Omega,\n\\end{align}\n$$\n","where the velocity field $\\beta := (\\sin(\\pi x_1) \\cos(\\pi x_2), -\\cos(\\pi x_1) \\sin(\\pi x_2))^{\\top}$, $x = (x_1, x_2)$, is a solenoidal field. The initial condition, $c_0(\\cdot; \\mu): \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, is given by the sum of three Wendland functions $\\bar{\\psi}_{2,1}^i$ of radius 0.4 and centers located at $(-0.6, -0.6)$, $(0, 0)$ and $(0.6, 0.6)$.\n","The Wendland functions are radial functions with compact support on the unit ball, and $\\psi_{2,1}(r)$ has the following closed form\n","\n$$\n\\psi_{2,1}(r)=(3r + 1) \\max \\{0,(1-r)^3\\}.\n$$\n","Appropriate transformations have been applied to $\\psi_{2,1}(r)$ in order to get the scaled and translated Wendland functions $\\bar{\\psi}_{2,1}^i$.\n","The velocity field $\\beta$, the initial condition $c_0(\\cdot; \\mu)$, and the boundaries are illustrated in the following figure.\n","\n","![initial condition](taylor-green-vortex/initial_condition.png)\n","\n\n","## Mathematical formulation for the reduced order problem\n\n","Given a value for $\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^p$, we solve the weak formulation of the previous problem by finding $c(t;\\mu) \\in V$ such that:\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n    m(\\partial_t c(t;\\mu),v) + a(c(t;\\mu),v;\\mu) = \\underbrace{f(v;t;\\mu)}_{=0 \\text{ in our case}} \\quad \\forall v \\in V \\quad \\text{and } t \\in \\mathcal{I}\n    \\label{eq:ExactParamPb}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n","where $V=H^1_{0, \\Gamma_D}(\\Omega)=\\{ v \\in H^1(\\Omega) \\mid v = 0 \\text{ on } \\Gamma_D \\}$, and $m(\\cdot,\\cdot): V \\times V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, $a(\\cdot,\\cdot;\\mu): V \\times V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ are the bilinear forms defined as:\n","\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n    m(u,v) =(u,v)_{L^2(\\Omega)} =\\int_{\\Omega} u\\, v \\, dx\n    \\\\\n    a(u, v;\\mu) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\mu  \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, + (\\beta \\cdot \\nabla u) v \\, dx\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n","Additionally, we are interested in a specific [[Output]](#Output):\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n    s(t;\\mu) = \\ell(c(t;\\mu);t;\\mu)\n\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n","## Affine decomposition (without boundary conditions)\n\n","The bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot;\\mu)$ is affine in the parameter $\\mu$, i.e.:\n","$a(\\cdot,\\cdot;\\mu) = \\sum_{q=1}^{Q_a} \\theta^a_q(\\mu) \\,a_q(\\cdot,\\cdot)$\n","where $a_q:V \\times V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ are bilinear forms independent of $\\mu$ and $\\theta^a_q: \\mathcal{P} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ are scalar quantities depending only on $\\mu$.\n","In particular, $Q_a=2$ and the decomposition is given by:\n","\n$$\n\\begin{align}\na(u,v;\\mu) &= \\int_{\\Omega} \\mu  \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, + (\\beta \\cdot \\nabla u) v \\, dx \\nonumber\\\\\n& =1 \\int_{\\Omega} (\\beta \\cdot \\nabla u) \\, v \\, dx + \\mu \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, dx \\nonumber\\\\\n&= \\theta^a_1(\\mu) \\, a_1(u,v) + \\theta^a_2(\\mu) \\, a_2(u,v)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n","where:\n","$\\theta^a_1(\\mu) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\theta^a_2(\\mu) = \\mu$\n","and:\n","$a_1(u,v) = \\int_{\\Omega} (\\beta \\cdot \\nabla u) \\, v \\, dx \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a_2(u,v) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, dx \\quad \\forall u,v \\in V.$\n","*Note:* ","In general, we seek an affine decomposition for both the bilinear form and the linear form in the variational formulation, as well as for the output functional $\\ell$.

This approach is known as the Nitsche&#8217;s method. We won&#8217;t go into mathematical details that can be found in [Feel++ documentation](https://docs.feelpp.org/math/fem/laplacian/nitsche.html), but we will just give the final expression of the affine decomposition. First we recall that we have homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\\Gamma_D$, and that Neumann boundary conditions are natural. Finally, we have the following affine decomposition:\n","\n$$\n\\begin{align}\na(u,v;\\mu) &=  1 \\left( \\int_{\\Omega} (\\beta \\cdot \\nabla u) \\, v \\, dx\n+ \\int_{\\Gamma_D} (\\beta \\cdot n) \\, u \\,v + \\frac{\\gamma}{h} \\, u \\, v \\, ds \\right) \\\\ &+\n \\mu \\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\, dx - \\int_{\\Gamma_D}(\\nabla u \\cdot n) \\,v + (\\nabla v\\cdot n) \\,u\\right) \\\\ \\\\\n&= \\theta^a_1(\\mu) \\, a_1(u,v) + \\theta^a_2(\\mu) \\, a_2(u,v)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n","where:\n","$\\theta^a_1(\\mu) = 1 , \\quad  \\theta^a_2(\\mu) = \\mu \\quad \\text{and} \\quad h \\text{ is the mesh size}$.\n","*Note:* ","\n","- The penalisation parameter $\\gamma$ must be chosen such that the coercivity (or inf-sup) property is satisfied. It is difficult to do in general. We increase $\\gamma$ until the weak Dirichlet boundary conditions are properly satisfied.\n","- Since we have homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions (i.e. $u=g=0 \\text{ on } \\Gamma_D$), we don&#8217;t have to include any term in the affine decomposition of the right hand side linear form.\n","\n","## Output\n\n","We are interested in non-compliant time-dependent multiple outputs defined as follows:\n","$s(t;\\mu)= (s_1(t;\\mu), s_2(t;\\mu), s_3(t;\\mu)) \\quad \\\\ \\\\ \\text{with} \\quad s_1(t;\\mu) = \\int_{\\Omega} c(t;\\mu) \\, \\eta_1 dx, \\quad s_2(t;\\mu) = \\int_{\\Omega} c(t;\\mu) \\, \\eta_2 dx \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_3(t;\\mu) = \\int_{\\Omega} c(t;\\mu) \\, \\eta_3 dx$\n","where $\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\eta_3$ are three Wendland functions $\\psi_{2,1}$ of radius 0.1 and centers $(0.1, 0.7), (0.1, 0.7) \\text{ and } (0.5, 0.1)$ respectively.\n","## Setup for the notebook simulation\n\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"fragment"}},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","girder_path = \"https://girder.math.unistra.fr/api/v1/item/64c165a5b0e9570499e1cc3c/download\"\n","fpp_name = 'ad.fpp'\n","time = np.linspace(start=0, stop=2.5, num=251)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Unresolved directive in index.adoc - include::partial$girder_fpp.adoc[]\n","Unresolved directive in index.adoc - include::partial$online_notebook.adoc[]\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"fragment"}},"outputs":[],"source":["import plotly.graph_objects as go\n","\n","for i in range(len(r)):\n","    # Create a Plotly figure with a scatter plot\n","    fig = go.Figure()\n","\n","    for o in range(len(r[i])):\n","        v=np.array(r[i][o].outputs())\n","        err=np.array(r[i][o].errors())\n","\n","        min_values = v*(1-10/100)\n","        max_values = v*(1+10/100)\n","        # print(f\"v: {v}\")\n","        # print(f\"min_values: {min_values}\")\n","        # print(f\"max_values: {max_values}\")\n","\n","        assert time.size == min_values.size == max_values.size == v.size\n","\n","        fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n","            x=time,\n","            y=v,\n","            mode='lines+markers',\n","            name=f'wendland-{o}'\n","        ))\n","\n","    # Update the layout of the figure\n","    fig.update_layout(\n","        title=f'Sensor outputs for mu={sampling[i]}',\n","        xaxis_title='Time',\n","        yaxis_title='Value',\n","\n","        # Use 'category' type for the x-axis to treat it as discrete dates\n","        xaxis=dict(tickformat='.2f'),\n","    )\n","\n","    # Show the plot\n","    fig.show()\n"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
