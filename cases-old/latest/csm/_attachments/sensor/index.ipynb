The most common type of strain gauge consists of an insulating flexible backing which supports a metallic foil pattern. The gauge is attached to the object by a suitable adhesive. As the object is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its electrical resistance to change. This resistance change, usually measured using a Wheatstone bridge, is related to the strain by the quantity known as the *gauge factor*.\n","* **CAD representation of a strain gauge**\\\n![image1](../../images/sensor/image1.png)\n* **Representation of a strain gauge**\\\n![image2](../../images/sensor/image2.png)\n* **Strain gauge**\\\n![image3](../../images/sensor/image3.png)\n","## Running the case\n\n","## Command line\n\n","The command line to run this case is\n","```mpirun\n","mpirun -np 4 feelpp_toolbox_solid --case \"github:{repo:toolbox,path:examples/modules/csm/examples/sensor}\"\n","```","*Note:* The report of the execution of the command above is available [here](sensor/solid.information.ipynb).\n","## Python interface\n\n","We start with the {feelpp} environment.\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"fragment"}},"outputs":[],"source":["from feelpp import *\n","from feelpp.toolboxes.core import *\n","from feelpp.toolboxes.solid import *\n","\n","# create the application\n","# create a feelppdb subdirectory where the results are stored\n","app = Environment(['feelpp_toolbox_solid'], opts= toolboxes_options(\"solid\"),config=localRepository(\"\"))\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Next we download the study configuration and simulate it\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"fragment"}},"outputs":[],"source":["sensorcfg=feelpp.download(\"github:{repo:toolbox,path:examples/modules/csm/examples/sensor/}\", worldComm=app.worldCommPtr())[0] #
