== Introduction

We implement the benchmark proposed by link:{biblio}#turek2006proposal[Turek and Hron], on the behavior of drag and lift forces of a flow around an object composed by a pole and a bar, see Figure <<img-geometry1>>.

The software and the numerical results were initially obtained from  link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Vincent Chabannes].

> **Note** This benchmark is linked to the link:../../CSM/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron CSM] and link:../../FSI/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron FSI ] benchmarks.

== Problem Description

We consider a 2D model representative of a laminar incompressible flow around an obstacle. The flow domain, named $$\Omega_f$$, is contained into the rectangle $$[0,2.5] \times [0,0.41] $$. It is characterised, in particular, by its dynamic viscosity $$\mu_f$$ and by its density $$\rho_f$$. In this case, the fluid material we used is glycerine.

In order to describe the flow, the link:../readme.adoc#_Incompressible_Navier-Stokes_model[ incompressible Navier-Stokes model] is chosen for this case, define by the conservation of momentum equation and the conservation of mass equation. At them, we add the material constitutive equation, that help us to define $$\boldsymbol{\sigma}_f$$


The goal of this benchmark is to study the behavior of lift forces $$F_L$$ and drag forces $$F_D$$, with three different fluid dynamics applied on the obstacle, i.e on $$\Gamma_{obst}$$, we made rigid by setting specific structure parameters. To simulate these cases, different mean inflow velocities, and thus different Reynolds numbers, will be used.

=== Boundary conditions

We set

* on $$\Gamma_{in}$$, an inflow Dirichlet condition.
$$
  \boldsymbol{u}_f=(v_{in},0);
$$

* on $$\Gamma_{wall}$$ and $$\Gamma_{obst}$$, a homogeneous Dirichlet condition.
$$
  \boldsymbol{u}_f=\boldsymbol{0};
$$

* on $$\Gamma_{out}$$, a Neumann condition
$$
  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_f\boldsymbol{n}_f=\boldsymbol{0};
$$

=== Initial conditions
We use a parabolic velocity profile, in order to describe the flow inlet by $$\Gamma_{in}$$, which can be express by

$$
  v_{cst} = 1.5 \bar{U} \frac{4}{0.1681} y \left(0.41-y\right)
$$
where $$\bar{U}$$ is the mean inflow velocity.

However, we want to impose a progressive increase of this velocity profile. That's why we define
$$
  v_{in} =
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
   & v_{cst} \frac{1-\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} t \right) }{2}  \quad & \text{ if } t < 2 \\
   & v_{cst}  \quad & \text{ otherwise }
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$

With t the time.

Moreover, in this case, there is no source term, so $$f_f\equiv 0$$.

== Outputs

As defined above, the goal of this benchmark is to measure the drag and lift forces, $$F_D$$ & $$F_L$$, to control the fluid solver behavior. They can be obtain from

$$
(F_D,F_L)=\int_{\Gamma_{obst}}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_f \boldsymbol{n}_f
$$

where $$\boldsymbol{n}_f$$ the outer unit normal vector from $$\partial \Omega_f$$.

== Discretization

To realize these tests, we made the choice to used $$P_N$$-$$P_{N-1}$$ Taylor-Hood finite elements, described by link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes], to discretize space. With the time discretization, we use BDF, for Backward Differentation Formulation, schemes at different orders $$q$$.

== Running the model

The configuration files are in `toolboxes/fluid/TurekHron`. The different cases are implemented in the corresponding `.cfg` files e.g. `cfd1.cfg`, `cfd2.cfg` and `cfd3.cfg`.

The command line in feelpp-toolboxes docker reads

.Command line to execute CFD1 testcase
[source,sh]
----
$ mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/bin/feelpp_toolbox_fluid_2d --config-file cfd1.cfg
----

The result files are then stored by default in

.Results Directory
[source,sh]
----
feel/applications/models/fluid/TurekHron/"case_name"/"velocity_space""pression_space""Geometric_order"/"processor_used"
----

For example, for CFD2 case executed on $$12$$ processors, with a $$P_2$$ velocity approximation space, a $$P_1$$ pressure approximation space and a geometric order of $$1$$, the path is

=== CFD3

As CFD3 is time-dependent ( from BDF use ), results will be expressed as

$$
 mean ± amplitude [frequency]
$$

Where

* mean is the average of the min and max values at the last period of oscillations.

$$
mean=\frac{1}{2}(max+min)
$$

* amplitude is the difference of the max and the min at the last oscillation.

$$
amplitude=\frac{1}{2}(max-min)
$$

* frequency can be obtain by Fourier analysis on periodic data and retrieve the lowest frequency or by the following formula, if we know the period time T.

$$
frequency=\frac{1}{T}
$$

== Geometrical Order

> **Note** Add a section on geometrical order.

== Conclusion

The reference results, link:{biblio}#turek2006proposal[Turek and Hron], have been obtained with a time step $$\Delta t=0.05$$. When we compare our results, with the same step and $$\mathrm{BDF}_2$$, we observe that they are in accordance with the reference results.

With a larger $$\Delta t$$, a discrepancy is observed, in particular for the drag force. It can also be seen at the same time step, with a higher order $$\mathrm{BDF}_n$$ ( _e.g._ $$\mathrm{BDF}_3$$ ). This suggests that the couple $$\Delta t=0.05$$ and $$\mathrm{BDF}_2$$ isn't enough accurate.
