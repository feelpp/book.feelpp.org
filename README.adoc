== What is {feelpp} ?
{feelpp} is a unified {cpp} implementation of Galerkin methods (finite and spectral element methods) in 1D, 2D and 3D to solve partial differential equations.

{feelpp} is

 . a versatile mathematical kernel solving easily problems using
   different techniques thus allowing testing and comparing methods, e.g. cG versus dG.

 . a *small* and *manageable* library which nevertheless encompasses a wide
   range of numerical methods and techniques and in particular reduced order
   methods such as the reduced basis method.

 . a software that follows closely the mathematical abstractions
   associated with partial differential equations (PDE) and in
   particular the finite element mathematical framework and
   variational formulations.

 . a library that offers solving strategies that scales up to
   thousands and even tens of thousands of cores.

 . a library entirely in {cpp} allowing to create {cpp} complex
   and typically non-linear multi-physics applications currently in industry, physics and health-care.

== Read the {feelpp} Book

All the {feelpp} manuals are available at {uri-www}.

== Help and Support

We're always happy to help out with {feelpp} or any other questions you might
have. You can ask a question or signal an issue at the Gitter {feelpp} salon.

== Contribute to this documentation

You can http://docs.feelpp.org/docs/stable/#_how_to_contribute[contribute] to improve this documentation on
https://github.com/feelpp/book.feelpp.org[GitHub].

See also link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[how to write the book].

== Generating the website

{feelpp} uses https://docs.antora.org[Antora] to generate the website http://docs.feelpp.org.

Once you have installed Antora, install the asciidoctor-plantuml package:
[source,sh]
--
npm i asciidoctor.js asciidoctor-plantuml
--
then follow the next steps to generate a local preview of the  website http://docs.feelpp.org.


[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/feelpp/book.feelpp.org.git <1>
cd book.feelpp.org <2>
antora --pull antora-local-feelpp-doc.yml <3>
serve build/site <4>
----
<1> clone the source for the website
<2> go the toplevel directory
<3> build a local preview of the website with Antora
<4> start the node.ja webserver `serve`, see the https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/run-antora/#local-site-preview[docs].
