== What is {feelpp} ?
{feelpp} is a unified {cpp} implementation of Galerkin methods (finite and spectral element methods) in 1D, 2D and 3D to solve partial differential equations.

{feelpp} is

 . a versatile mathematical kernel solving easily problems using
   different techniques thus allowing testing and comparing methods, e.g. cG versus dG.
   
 . a *small* and *manageable* library which nevertheless encompasses a wide
   range of numerical methods and techniques and in particular reduced order
   methods such as the reduced basis method.
   
 . a software that follows closely the mathematical abstractions
   associated with partial differential equations (PDE) and in
   particular the finite element mathematical framework and
   variational formulations.
   
 . a library that offers solving strategies that scales up to
   thousands and even tens of thousands of cores.
   
 . a library entirely in {cpp} allowing to create {cpp} complex
   and typically non-linear multi-physics applications currently in industry, physics and health-care.

== Compiling the book

=== Using Docker

The {feelpp} book toolchain is installed in the `feelpp/feelpp-env` docker image

----
docker run --rm -it feelpp/feelpp-env
----

==== Installing the toolchain

. install `ruby` and  `bundle`

----
# On MacOSX do
brew install ruby
gem install rake bundle

# on debian/ubuntu
apt-get install ruby-bundler
----

. Install the gems into the project

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle config --local github.https true
$ bundle --path=.bundle/gems --binstubs=.bundle/.bin
----

NOTE: it installs all the requirements

then type

----
bundle exec jekyll serve
----

NOTE: it starts a link:http://127.0.0.1:4000/[local web server] on the
port 4000 where you can read the book.
