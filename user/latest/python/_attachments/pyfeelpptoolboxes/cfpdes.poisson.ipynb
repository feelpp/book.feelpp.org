\\Delta u=\\sum_{i=1}^d \\partial_{i i}^2 u is the Laplacian of u.\n","Equation , which imposes the nullity of the solution u on the domain boundary, is called a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.\n","Other boundary conditions (non-homogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin) are possible and will be discussed later on.\n","The problem is used in many physical models, in particular\n","\n","- in heat transfer where u represents the temperature,\n","- in electrostatics where u represents an electric potential,\n","- in mechanics where u represents a vertical membrane displacement, and\n","- in hydraulics where u represents a charge in a Darcy flow.\n","\n","A second example of a coercive problem is the advection-diffusion-reaction equations with dominant diffusion which we shall study .\n","A third example is provided by the mechanics of continuous deformable media in the framework of linear elasticity which we shall study .\n","In this case, the unknown is a function u: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d which represents a displacement field.\n","*Note:* Coercive problems provided the first framework for the application of the finite element method, when engineers used this method in the 1950&#8217;s to approximate the solution of deformable continuum mechanics problems.\n","The mathematical analysis of coercivity problems is relatively simple since it is based on the Lax-Milgram lemma.\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## The mathematical framework\n\n","We assume for simplicity that the data f is in L^2(\\Omega).\n","The

\\nabla w=\\int_{\\Omega} f w, \\quad \\forall w \\in H_0^1(\\Omega) .\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n","Introducing the functional space V=H_0^1(\\Omega), the bilinear form a \\in \\mathcal{L}(V \\times V; \\mathbb{R}) defined by a(v, w)=\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla v \\cdot \\nabla w and the linear form f \\in V^{\\prime} defined by f(w)=\\int_{\\Omega} f w, the   is written in the

characteristic length of the bounded open \\Omega.\n","The PoincarÃ© inequality implies the coercivity of the bilinear form a on H_0^1(\\Omega) since\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\forall v \\in

\\mathcal{C}^0(\\bar{\\Omega}) which are continuous on the boundary of \\Omega and which are piecewise polynomials of degree k on each element of \\mathcal{T}_h.\n","In order to construct an
