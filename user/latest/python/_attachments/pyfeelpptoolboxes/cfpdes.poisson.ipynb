problems.\n","The prototype is the Dirichlet problem: given a function $f: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$,  look for a function $u: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\Delta u & =f & & \\text { in } \\Omega, \\\\\nu & =0 & & \\text { on } \\partial \\Omega,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n","where $\\Delta u=\\sum_{i=1}^d \\partial_{i i}^2 u$ is the Laplacian of $u$.\n","Equation , which imposes the nullity of the solution $u$ on the domain boundary, is called a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.\n","Other boundary conditions (non-homogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin) are possible and will be discussed later on.\n","The problem is used in many physical models, in particular\n","\n","- in heat transfer where $u$ represents the temperature,\n","- in electrostatics where $u$ represents an electric potential,\n","- in mechanics where $u$ represents a vertical membrane displacement, and\n","- in hydraulics where $u$ represents a charge in a Darcy flow.\n","\n","A second example of a coercive problem is the advection-diffusion-reaction equations with dominant diffusion which we shall study .\n","A third example is provided by the mechanics of continuous deformable media in the framework of linear elasticity which we shall study .\n","In this case, the unknown is a function $u: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d$ which represents a displacement field.\n","*Note:* Coercive problems provided the first framework for the application of the finite element method, when engineers used this method in the 1950&#8217;s to approximate the solution of deformable continuum mechanics problems.\n","The mathematical analysis of coercivity problems is relatively simple since it is based on the Lax-Milgram lemma.\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## The mathematical framework\n\n","We assume for simplicity that the data $f$ is in $L^2(\\Omega)$.\n","The weak formulation of the   is the following:\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text { Find } u \\in H_0^1(\\Omega) \\text { such that } \\\\\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\ \\nabla w=\\int_{\\Omega} f w, \\quad \\forall w \\in H_0^1(\\Omega) .\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n","Introducing the functional space $V=H_0^1(\\Omega)$, the bilinear form $a \\in \\mathcal{L}(V \\times V; \\mathbb{R})$ defined by $a(v, w)=\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla v \\cdot \\nabla w$ and the linear form $f \\in V^{\\prime}$ defined by $f(w)=\\int_{\\Omega} f w$, the   is written in the following abstract form:\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text { Find } u \\in V \\text { such that } \\\\\na(u, w)=f(w), \\quad \\forall w \\in V .\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n","The space $V$ equipped with the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{1, \\Omega}$ (defined by $\\|v\\|_{1, \\Omega}=\\left(\\|v\\|_{0, \\Omega}^2+\\|\\nabla v\\|_{0, \\Omega}^2\\right)^{1 / 2}$ for $v \\in V$ ) is a Hilbert space and the forms $a$ and $f$ are continuous on $V \\times V$ and $V$, respectively.\n","The only non-trivial property to establish the well-posedness of  is the coercivity of $a$ on $H_0^1(\\Omega)$.\n","This results from the following inequality\n","*Note:* the constant $\\ell_{\\Omega}$ has the dimension of a length; it can be interpreted as a characteristic length of the bounded open $\\Omega$.\n","The PoincarÃ© inequality implies the coercivity of the bilinear form $a$ on $H_0^1(\\Omega)$ since\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\forall v \\in H_0^1(\\Omega), \\quad a(v, v)=\\|\\nabla v|_{0, \\Omega}^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{1+\\ell_{\\Omega}^2}\\|v\\|_{1, \\Omega}^2 .\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n","The Lax-Milgram lemma allows us to conclude that the  is well-posed.\n","## Conforming Approximation\n\n","We consider a conformal approximation of   by Lagrange finite elements.\n","We assume for simplicity that $\\Omega$ is a $\\mathbb{R}^2$ polygon or a $\\mathbb{R}^3$ polyhedron.\n","We consider a regular and conformal family of affine meshes of $\\Omega$ which we denote $\\left\\{\\mathcal{T}_h\\right\\}_{h>0}$.\n","We choose as finite element of reference $\\left\\{\\widehat{K}, \\widehat{P}, \\widehat{\\Sigma}\\right\\}$ a finite element of Lagrange such that $\\mathbb{P}_k \\subset \\widehat{P}$ and $k+1>\\frac{d}{2}$\n","We pose\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nP_{\\mathrm{c}, h}^k=\\left\\{v_h \\in \\mathcal{C}^0(\\bar{\\Omega}); \\forall K \\in \\mathcal{T}_h, v_h \\circ T_K \\in \\widehat{P}\\right\\}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n","where $T_K$ is the geometric transformation sending $\\widehat{K}$ into $K$.\n","The space $P_{\\mathrm{c}, h}^k$ is the space of the functions of $\\mathcal{C}^0(\\bar{\\Omega})$ which are continuous on the boundary of $\\Omega$ and which are piecewise polynomials of degree $k$ on each element of $\\mathcal{T}_h$.\n","In order to construct an approximation space which is included in $V=H_0^1(\\Omega)$, we pose\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nV_h=P_{\\mathrm{c}, h}^k \\cap H_0^1(\\Omega)\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n","The elements of $V_h$ are the functions of $P_{\\mathrm{c}, h}^k$ which are $0$ on the boundary of $\\Omega$.\n","We consider the following approximate problem:\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text { Find } u_h \\in V_h \\text { such that } \\\\\na\\left(u_h, v_h\\right)=f\\left(v_h\\right), \\quad \\forall v_h \\in

dimension 2 or 3 is that of the Lagrangian finite element approximation $\\mathbb{P}_1$ or $\\mathbb{Q}_1$, for which, if  is regularizing, we have\n","\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left\\|u-u_h\\right\\|_{0, \\Omega}+h\\left\\|u-u_h\\right\\|_{1, \\Omega} \\leq c h^2\\|f\\|_{0, \\Omega} .\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n","We thus obtain a convergence
