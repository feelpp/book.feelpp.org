The coefficients of the differential operators are also discretized on the mesh, in time and depend on parameters.\n","The resulting system of linear equations is then solved to obtain the numerical solution.\n","[toolboxes:cfpdes:partial$introduction.adoc](toolboxes:cfpdes:partial$introduction.adoc)\n"],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.9.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
