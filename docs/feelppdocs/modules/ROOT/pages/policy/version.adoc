{feelpp} follows the https://semver.org[semantic versioning] rules.
Each {feelpp} component release is versioned *major.minor.patch*.

Major::
Major releases occur when there are substantial changes in functionality or when new functionality breaks backwards compatibility.
Releases within the same major version number will maintain API compatibility.

Minor::
Minor releases add new features, improvements to existing features, and fixes that maintain backwards compatibility.

Patch::
Patch releases fix bugs and maintain backwards compatibility.
Only the latest minor release for a major release will receive patches.
Patch releases happen as needed depending on the urgency of the fix.

Pre-release::
Major and minor releases may include pre-release versions (major.minor.patch-alpha.n | -beta.n | -rc.n).
Pre-release versions will be tagged as _next_ so that the npm client doesn't prefer a pre-release over a stable version.
Once a release candidate (rc) has been thoroughly tested, the stable release will be published.
