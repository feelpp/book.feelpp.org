{feelpp} is an Open-Source {cpp} library which allows to solve a large range of partial differential equations using Galerkin methods,
e.g. finite element method, spectral element method, discontinuous Galerkin methods or reduced basis methods.
Feel++ enables parallel computing in a seamless way and allows to solve large scale systems up to tens of thousands of cores.
