= Quick Starts with singularity

== Installation Quick Start

Using {feelpp} inside <<using/what-is-docker.adoc#what-is-docker,Docker>> is the recommended and fastest way to use {feelpp}.
The <<using/README.adoc#docker,Docker>> chapter is dedicated to Docker and using {feelpp} in Docker.

We strongly encourage you to follow these steps if you begin with {feelpp} in particular as an end-user.

People who would like to develop with and in {feelpp} should read through the remaining sections of this chapter.

== Usage Start

Start the Docker container `feelpp/feelpp-base` or `feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes` as follows

[source,sh]
----
> docker run -it -v $HOME/feel:/feel feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes
----

NOTE: these steps are explained in the chapter on <<02-docker/feelpp-containers.adoc#feelpp-containers,{feelpp} containers>>.

Then run _e.g._ the {uri-rel-file-base}/quickstart/qs_laplacian.cpp[Quickstart Laplacian] that solves the Laplacian problem in <<lap-seq>> or in <<lap-par>>.

[[lap-seq]]
[source,sh]
.Quickstart Laplacian sequential
----
> feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d --config-file Testcases/quickstart/laplacian/feelpp2d/feelpp2d.cfg
----

The results are stored in Docker in
----
/feel/qs_laplacian/feelpp2d/np_1/exports/ensightgold/qs_laplacian/
----
and on your computer
----
$HOME/feel/qs_laplacian/feelpp2d/np_1/exports/ensightgold/qs_laplacian/
----
The mesh and solutions can be visualized using _e.g._ Parariew or Visit.

[TIP]
====

link:https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit[Visit]:: is a distributed, parallel visualization and graphical analysis tool for data defined on two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) meshes
====

[[lap-par]]
[source,sh]
.Quickstart Laplacian on 4 cores in parallel
----
> mpirun -np 4 feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d --config-file Testcases/quickstart/laplacian/feelpp2d/feelpp2d.cfg
----

The results are stored in a simular place as above: just replace `np_1` by `np_4` in the paths above. The results should look like

== Syntax Start

Here are some  excerpts from {uri-rel-file-base}/quickstart/qs_laplacian.cpp[Quickstart Laplacian] that solves the Laplacian problem. It shows some of the features of {feelpp} and in particular the domain specific language for Galerkin methods.

First we load the mesh, define the function space define some expressions
[source,cpp]
.Laplacian problem in an arbitrary geometry, loading mesh and defining spaces
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feelpp/feelpp/develop/quickstart/qs_laplacian.cpp[tags=mesh_space]
----

Second we define the linear and bilinear forms to solve the problem

[source,cpp]
.Laplacian problem in an arbitrary geometry, defining forms and solving
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feelpp/feelpp/develop/quickstart/qs_laplacian.cpp[tags=forms]
----

More explanations are available in <<learning.adoc#Laplacian,Learning by examples>>.
