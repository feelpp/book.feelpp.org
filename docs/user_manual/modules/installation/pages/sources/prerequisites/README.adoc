== Compilers

{feelpp} uses {cpp}14 compilers such as GCC6 and Clang. Currently it is not mandatory to have a C++14 stantard library but it will be soon.

[WARNING]
====
There used to be a major compatibility issue between llvm/clang and GCC
compilers since GCC5 released the ABI tag which makes it impossible to compile
{feelpp} using llvm/clang with GCC5 or GCC6 standard libraries for a
time. Please see the following table to understand the working {cpp} compiler /
{cpp} standard library combinations.
====

.Table {cpp} compilers and standard libraries combinations
|===
| Compiler  | Standard Library

| clang (3.6, 3.7, 3.8) | libstdc{plus}{plus} 4.9
| clang  |  libc{plus}{plus} (corresponding clang version)
| clang (3.8(requires patches), 3.9)  | libstdc{plus}{plus} 6
| GCC 6 | libstdc{plus}{plus} 6

|===

CAUTION: GCC 6.2.1 seems to be problematic on debian/testing -- the tests in the testsuite fail. -- GCC 6.3.1 or GCC 6.2.0 don't have any problems.

== Required tools and libraries

Other than {cpp}14 compilers, {feelpp} requires only a few tools and libraries, namely CMake, Boost C++ libraries and an MPI implementation such as open-mpi or mpich. The table below provides information regarding the minimum and maximum version supported. A -- means it has not necessarily been tested with the latest version but we do not expect any issues. Note that for MPI, an implementation with MPI-IO support would be best.

| Name | Minimum Version | Maximum Version | Notes

| CMake | 3.0 | -- |
| MPI   | -- | -- | openmpi or mpich
| Boost | 1.61 | 1.63 |

== Recommended libraries

Here is a list of libraries that we recommend to use jointly with Feel++.

.Table optional external libraries

|===
| Library | Minimum Version | Maximum Version  | Notes

| HDF5  | 1.8.6  | 1.8.16  | Enables high performance I/O; Enables MED Support; Be careful on Debian/sid a more recent version of HDF5 breaks MED support
| PETSc | 3.2 | 3.8.2 | Last is best; a requirement for parallel and high performance computing
| SLEPc | 3.2 | 3.8.1 | last is best; a requirement for eigenvalue problem; depends on PETSc
| Gmsh  | 2.8.7 | 2.16 | last is best; a requirement if you want to be able to read many file formats; HDF5 version in Debian/sid currently breaks MED format support.
| Superlu  ||| superlu and superlu_dist
| Suitesparse ||| umfpack (colamd,amd)
| OpenTURNS | 2.0 || Uncertainty quantification
| Python Libs |  3.0 || Python 3 libraries
| Python Sympy |  1.1 || Python 3 module sympy
