Feel++ is  supported on Mac OSX, starting from OS X 10.9 Mavericks to OS X 10.12 Sierra using <<Homebrew>> or <<MacPorts>>.

== First step

Xcode is required on Mac OSX to install Feel{plus}{plus}.

The easiest way to do so is to go through the Apple Store application and to search for Xcode. Xcode will provide the programming environment, _e.g_ clang, for the next steps.

[[Homebrew]]
== Homebrew

=== Introduction to HomeBrew
Homebrew is a free/open source software introduced to simplify the installation of other free/open source software on MacOS X. Homebrew is distributed under the link:https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/LICENSE[BSD] 2 Clause (NetBSD) license. For more information, visit their link:http://brew.sh[website].

==== Installation

To install the latest version of Homebrew, simply
visit their link:http://brew.sh[website] and follow the instructions. Each new package Homebrew installs is built into an intermediate place called the Cellar (usually /usr/local/Cellar) and
then the packages are symlinked into /usr/local (default).

==== Key commands

Homebrew base command is `brew`. Here is a list of base available commands:

* `brew doctor`: Check if the system has any problem with the current installation of Homebrew;

* `brew install mypackage`: This command installs the package mypackage;

* `brew install [--devel|--HEAD] mypackage`: These options respectively installs either the development version or the HEAD version of the package mypackage, if such versions are specified in the Formula file;

* `brew uninstall mypackage`: This command allows to uninstall the package mypackage.

==== Formulas

A Formula is a link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] script format specific to Homebrew. It allows to describe the installation process of a package. Feel\++ uses specific Formulae that you can get in the Feel++ github repository: link:https://github.com/feelpp/homebrew-feelpp[feelpp/homebrew-feelpp].

===  Installation

This section is aimed at users that do not have Homebrew already installed. +
In order to build Feel++ from Homebrew, you have to do the following steps:

First install Homebrew
[source,sh]
----
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----

then check your Homebrew installation and fix warnings/errors if necessary

[source,sh]
----
$ brew doctor
----

Install Homebrew-science tap to get the link:prerequisites.adoc[scientific software] recommended or suggested for Feel{plus}{plus}.
----
$ brew tap homebrew/homebrew-science 
----
you should see something like
[source,sh]
----
==> Tapping homebrew/science
Cloning into '/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-science'...
remote: Counting objects: 661, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (656/656), done.
remote: Total 661 (delta 0), reused 65 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (661/661), 591.93 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Tapped 644 formulae (680 files, 1.9M)
----

Next you install Feel{plus}{plus} tap with
[source,sh]
----
brew tap feelpp/homebrew-feelpp
----
you should read something like
[source,sh]
----
==> Tapping feelpp/feelpp
Cloning into '/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/feelpp/homebrew-feelpp'...
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 4 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Tapped 1 formula (30 files, 60.7K)
----

The final step is to either install Feel{plus}{plus} 
[source,sh]
----
$ brew install feelpp
----

or just Feel{plus}{plus} dependencies if you plan to build Feel++ from sources yourself
[source,sh]
----
$ brew install --only-dependencies feelpp
----

> **Note** If you encounter problems, you can fix them using `brew doctor`. A frequent issue is to force `open-mpi` with `brew link --overwrite open-mpi`

===  Advanced usage

If Homebrew is already installed on your system, you might want to customize your installation for the correct dependencies to be met for Feel++.

==== Feel++ Dependencies
You can browse Feel++ dependencies using the following command:

[source,sh]
----
$ brew deps feelpp | column
----

you get the list of formulas Feel{plus}{plus} depends on for its installation
[source,txt]
----
ann		fftw		libtool		slepc
arpack		gcc		metis		suite-sparse
autoconf	glpk		mumps		sundials
automake	gmp		netcdf		superlu
boost		gmsh		open-mpi	superlu_dist
cln		hdf5		parmetis	szip
cmake		hwloc		petsc		tbb
eigen		hypre		scalapack	veclibfort
----

==== Customizing builds
If you want to customize the compilation process for a dependency (Set debug mode, Remove checking steps, Remove the link with certain libraries, etc.), you can access to the building options with the `info` flag. For exemple, with open-mpi:

[source,sh]
----
$ brew info open-mpi
----

You get various information about the `open-mpi` formula
[source,sh]
----
open-mpi: stable 2.0.1 (bottled), HEAD
High performance message passing library
https://www.open-mpi.org/
Conflicts with: lcdf-typetools, mpich
/usr/local/Cellar/open-mpi/2.0.1 (688 files, 8.6M) *
  Built from source on 2016-09-26 at 10:36:46 with: --c++11 --with-mpi-thread-multiple
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/open-mpi.rb
==> Dependencies
Required: libevent ✔
==> Requirements
Recommended: fortran ✔
Optional: java ✔
==> Options
--c++11
	Build using C++11 mode
--with-cxx-bindings
	Enable C++ MPI bindings (deprecated as of MPI-3.0)
--with-java
	Build with java support
--with-mpi-thread-multiple
	Enable MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE
--without-fortran
	Build without fortran support
--HEAD
	Install HEAD version
----

Then, you then just have to pass the needed flags, when installing the dependency. 

> **Important:**  `boost` has to be installed with mpi and c++11 support and `mumps` needs to be installed with the following scotch5 support.


[[MacPorts]]
== MacPorts

=== Introduction

MacPorts is an open-source community projet which aims to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing and upgrading open-source software on Mac OS X operating system. It is distributed under link:http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php[BSD License] and facilitate the access to thousands of ports (software) without installing or compiling open-source software. MacPorts provides a single software tree which includes the latest stable releases of approximately 17700 ports targeting the current Mac OS X release (10.9). If you want more information, please visit their link:http://www.macports.org/[website].

==== MacPorts Installation

To install the latest version of MacPorts, please go
to http://www.macports.org/install.php[Installing
MacPorts] page and follow the instructions. The simplest way is to
install it with the Mac OS X Installer using the `pkg` file
provided on their website. It is recommended that you install X11 (X Window System) which is normally used to display X11 applications. +
If you have installed with the package installer (`MacPorts-2.x.x.pkg`) that means MacPorts will be installed in
`/opt/local`. From now on, we will suppose that macports has
been installed in `/opt/local` which is the default MacPorts
location. Note that from now on, all tools installed by MacPorts will be installed in `/opt/local/bin` or `/opt/local/sbin`
for example (that's here you'll find gcc4.7 or later e.g
`/opt/local/bin/g++-mp-4.7` once being installed).

==== Key commands

In your command-line, the software MacPorts is called by the command `port`. Here is a list of key commands for using MacPorts, if you want more informations please go to http://guide.macports.org/#using.port[MacPorts Commands].

 * `sudo port -v selfupdate`: This action should be used regularly to update the local tree with the global MacPorts ports. The option `-v` enables verbose which generates verbose messages.
 
 * `port info mypackage`: This action is used to get information about a port. (description, license, maintainer, etc.)
 
 * `sudo port install mypackage`: This action install the port mypackage.
 
 * `sudo port uninstall mypackage`: This action uninstall the port mypackage.
 
 * `port installed`: This action displays all ports installed and their versions, variants and activation status. You can also use the `-v` option to also display the platform and CPU architecture(s) for which the ports were built, and any variants which were explicitly negated.
 
 * `sudo port upgrade mypackage`: This action updgrades installed ports and their dependencies when a `Portfile` in the repository has been updated. To avoid the upgrade of a port's dependencies, use the option `-n`.

==== Portfile 

A Portfile is a TCL script which usually contains simple
keyword values and TCL expressions. Each package/port has a
corresponding Portfile but it's only a part of a port description.
Feel\++ provides some mandatory Portfiles for its compilation which are either not available in MacPorts or are buggy but Feel++ also provides some Portfiles which are already available in MacPorts such as gmsh or petsc. They usually provide either some fixes to ensure Feel++ works properly or new version not yet available in MacPorts. These Portfiles are installed in `ports/macosx/macports`.


=== Installation

To be able to install Feel++, add the following line in
`/opt/local/etc/macports/source.conf` at the top of the file
before any other sources:

[source,sh]
----
file:///<path to feel top directory>/ports/macosx/macports
----

Once it's done, type in a command-line:

[source,sh]
----
 $ cd <your path to feel top directory>/ports/macosx/macports
 $ sudo portindex -f
----

You should have an output like this:

[source,sh]
----
Reading port index in $<$your path to feel top directory$>$/ports/macosx/macports
Adding port science/feel++
Adding port science/gmsh
Adding port science/petsc

Total number of ports parsed:   3
Ports successfully parsed:      3
Ports failed:                   0
Up-to-date ports skipped:       0
----

Your are now able to type

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo port install feel++
----

It might take some time (possibly an entire day) to compile all the requirements for Feel++ to compile properly. If you have several cores on your MacBook Pro, iMac or MacBook, we suggest that you configure macports to use all or some of them.

To do that uncomment the following line in the file
`/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf`

[source,bash]
----
buildmakejobs	0 $\#$ all the cores
----

At the end of the `sudo port install feel++`, you have all
dependencies installed. To build all the Makefile, `\cmake` is
automatically launched but can have some libraries may not be found but they are not mandatory for build Feel{plus}+, only the features related to the missing libraries will be missing.

.Missing ports
[NOTE]
====
`cmake` can build Makefiles even if some packages are missing (latex2html, VTK ...). It's not necessary to install them but you can complete the installation with MacPorts, `cmake` will find them by itself once they have been installed.
