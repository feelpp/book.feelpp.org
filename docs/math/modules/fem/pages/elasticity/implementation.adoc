= Impl√©mentation

We start by setting the {feelpp} environment
[source,cpp]
----
include::example$qs_elasticity.cpp[tag=env]
----

Next, we define the Mesh stem:[\cal{T}_h]
[source,cpp]
----
include::example$qs_elasticity.cpp[tag=mesh]
----

Next, we define the function space stem:[X^1_h]
[source,cpp]
----
include::example$qs_elasticity.cpp[tag=space]
----

and the linear stem:[\ell] and bilinear form stem:[a]
[source,cpp]
----
include::example$qs_elasticity.cpp[tag=forms]
----

We solve the algebraic system stem:[A \disp{d} = b]
[source,cpp]
----
include::example$qs_elasticity.cpp[tag=solver]
----

We attach to the algebraic backend the near null space that may be useful for Multigrid methods and optionally the null space.
To do that we build a basis spanning the (near) null space  in 2D and 3D.
[source,cpp]
----
include::example$qs_elasticity.cpp[tag=kernel]
----
<1> basis for translation stem:[\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)\}]
<2> basis for rotation stem:[\{(y,-x,0),(-z,0,x),(0,z,-y)\}]
<3> build the null space spanned by the translation and rotation basis

Finally, we export the solution for visualization in Paraview
