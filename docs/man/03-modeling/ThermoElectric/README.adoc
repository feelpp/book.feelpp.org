= Thermo-Electric Toolbox
:stem: latexmath

This section focuses on defining and solving of a thermo-electric model, which couples heat transfer and electrostatic models.
The current flow inside an electrical conductor leads to the heating of the material, due to Joule effect.
The temperature in the conductor can be deduced from the standard heat equation whose source term reads from the electrical potential to mimic the Joule effect.

In the following sections, the domain is denoted by stem:[\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d], stem:[d=2,3] and its border by stem:[\Gamma].

== Electrostatic problem

The electrostatic model consists in a diffusion equation. The electrical potential stem:[V] satisfies
[stem]
++++
\nabla\cdot(-\sigma\nabla V) = 0 ~~\text{in}~~ \Omega
++++
where stem:[\sigma] is the electrical conductivity.

NOTE: The electrical conductivity stem:[\sigma] often depends on the temperature. The thermo-electric model becomes non-linear in this case.

The current flow within the conductor is modeled by a difference in electrical potential between the current input stem:[\Gamma_{in} \subset \Gamma] and the current output stem:[\Gamma_{out} \subset \Gamma].

* stem:[V=0 ~~\text{on}~~ \Gamma_{in}]
* stem:[V=V_{out} ~~\text{on}~~ \Gamma_{out}].

We consider in this model that all other boundaries are electrically insulating. This conditions reads from the current density stem:[\mathbf{j} = - \sigma \nabla V] as

* stem:[\mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{n} = -\sigma\nabla V\cdot\mathbf{n} = 0 ~~\text{on}~~ \Gamma  \setminus (\Gamma_{in} \cup \Gamma_{out})].

The local form of Joule's law defines the heat source corresponding to Joule effect as the dot product of the current density stem:[\mathbf{j} = - \sigma \nabla V] by the electric field stem:[E=-\nabla V].
This product stem:[P = \sigma \nabla V \cdot \nabla V] will be the source term of the heat equation defined in the next section.

== Heat transfer problem

The temperature stem:[T] satisfies the standard heat equation with the previously introduced Joule effect as source term,
[stem]
++++
\nabla\cdot(-k\nabla T) = \sigma\nabla V\cdot \nabla V ~~\text{in}~~ \Omega
++++
where stem:[k] is the thermal conductivity. +

NOTE: As for the electrical conductivity stem:[\sigma], the thermal conductivity stem:[k] can also depends on temperature.

The thermal flux can eventually be controled by a water cooling process which limit the heating.
The thermal exchange between the electrical conductor and the cooling water is governed by a convection phenomenon involving a heat transfert coefficient stem:[h] and the water temperature stem:[T_c].
This cooling process is handled by a Robin condition on the cooled regions stem:[\Gamma_{c} \subset \Gamma]

* stem:[-k\nabla T\cdot\mathbf{n} = h(T-T_c) ~~\text{on}~~ \Gamma_{C}]

We consider that the thermal exchanges are limited to the cooled region, which amounts to apply an homogeneous Neumann condition on all other boundaries.

* stem:[-k\nabla T\cdot \mathbf{n} = 0 ~~\text{on}~~ \Gamma \setminus \Gamma_{C}]


== Thermo-Electric problem

In the thermo-electric model, we have 4 parameters

* stem:[\sigma] the electrical conductivity
* stem:[k] the thermal conductivity
* stem:[T_c] the water cooling temperature
* stem:[h] the heat transfer coefficient

NOTE: These parameters can be scalars of fields. 

We gather in the following table parameter ranges, nominal values as well as units for stem:[\sigma, k, T_c, h].

.Table of parameters for the simulation
|===
| Parameters | Ranges |  Nominal value | Units
| stem:[\sigma] | stem:[[52.10^{6};58.10^{6}]] | stem:[53\cdot 10^{6}] | stem:[S \cdot m^{-1}]
| stem:[k] | stem:[[360;380]]| stem:[370] | stem:[W\cdot m^{-1} \cdot K^{-1}$]
| stem:[T_c] | stem:[[293;310]] | stem:[300] | K
| stem:[h] | stem:[[70000;90000]] | stem:[850000] | stem:[W \cdot m^{-2} \cdot K^{-1}]
|===

In the linear case, we first solve for stem:[V] and then  for stem:[T] using stem:[V] to compute the Joule effect that generates heat inside stem:[\Omega].
