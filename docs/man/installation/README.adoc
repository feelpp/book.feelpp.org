====
We propose different way to install {feelpp} with varying difficulty.
We encourage new {feelpp} user to follow the <<containers,container method>> which is the simplest!

Be aware that native installation might be a complex process as {feelpp} require
additional software depending on feature you desire to enable. Thus only advanced
users should follow this path.
