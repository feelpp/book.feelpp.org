Feel++ is not packaged for Windows operating system.
We recommend to windows users to use docker software.
Another solution is to use cygwin and follow linux installation.
In the future, the Linux Subsystem for windows 10 (WSL)
should easier Feel++ installation using either ubuntu packages,
or singularity native installation.
