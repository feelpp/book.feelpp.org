= The Laplacian

== Problem statement

We are interested in this section in the _conforming finite element approximation_ of the following problem:

[[laplacian]]
.Laplacian problem
****
Look for stem:[u] such that

[stem]
++++
\left\{\begin{split}                                                                                                                                              -\Delta u &= f \text{ in } \Omega\\                                                                                                                           u &= g \text{ on } \partial \Omega_D\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &=h \text{ on } \partial \Omega_N\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + u &=l \text{ on } \partial \Omega_R
 \end{split}\right.
++++
****

CAUTION: stem:[\partial \Omega_D], stem:[\partial \Omega_N] and stem:[\partial \Omega_R] can be empty sets. In the case stem:[\partial \Omega_D =\partial \Omega_R = \emptyset], then the solution is known up to a constant.

[NOTE]
======
In the implementation presented later, stem:[\partial \Omega_D =\partial \Omega_N = \partial \Omega_R = \emptyset], then we set Dirichlet boundary conditions all over the boundary. The problem then reads like a standard laplacian with inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions:

.Laplacian Problem with inhomogeneous Dirichlet conditions
****
Look for stem:[u] such that

[stem]
.Inhomogeneous Dirichlet Laplacian problem
++++
-\Delta u = f\ \text{ in } \Omega,\quad u = g \text{ on } \partial \Omega
++++
****
======


== Variational formulation

We assume that stem:[f, h, l \in L^2(\Omega)]. The weak formulation of the problem then reads:

.Laplacian problem variational formulation
****
Look for stem:[u \in H^1_{g,\Gamma_D}(\Omega)] such that

[stem]
.Variational formulation
++++
\displaystyle\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v +\int_{\Gamma_R} u v = \displaystyle \int_\Omega f\ v+ \int_{\Gamma_N} g\ v + \int_{\Gamma_R} l\ v,\quad \forall v \in H^1_{0,\Gamma_D}(\Omega)
++++
****

== Conforming Approximation

We now turn to the finite element approximation using Lagrange finite
element. We assume stem:[\Omega] to be a segment in 1D, a polygon in
2D or a polyhedron in 3D.  We denote stem:[V_\delta \subset
H^1(\Omega)] an approximation space such that stem:[V_{g,\delta}
\equiv P^k_{c,\delta}\cap H^1_{g,\Gamma_D}(\Omega)].

The weak formulation reads:

.Laplacian problem weak formulation
****
Look for stem:[u_\delta \in V_\delta  ] such that

[stem]
++++
\displaystyle\int_{\Omega_\delta} \nabla u_{\delta} \cdot \nabla v_\delta +\int_{\Gamma_{R,\delta}} u_\delta\ v_\delta = \displaystyle \int_{\Omega_\delta} f\ v_\delta+ \int_{\Gamma_{N,\delta}} g\ v_\delta + \int_{\Gamma_{R,\delta}} l\ v_\delta,\quad \forall v_\delta \in V_{0,\delta}
++++
****

NOTE: from now on, we omit stem:[\delta] to lighten the notations. Be
careful that it appears both the geometrical and approximation level.



[[implementation]]
== Feel++ Implementation

In Feel{plus}{plus},  stem:[V_{g,\delta}] is not built but rather
stem:[P^k_{c,\delta}].

NOTE: The Dirichlet boundary conditions can be treated using different techniques and we use from now on the elimination technique.

We start with the mesh

[source,cpp]
----
include::qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=mesh]
----


NOTE: the keyword `auto` enables type inference, for more details see link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Type_inference[Wikipedia C{plus}{plus}11 page].


Next the discretization setting by first defining `Vh=Pch<k>(mesh)` stem:[\equiv P^k_{c,h}], then elements of `Vh` and expressions `f`, `n` and `g` given by command line options or configuration file.

[source,cpp]
----
include::qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=discr]
----

[NOTE]
======
at the following line

[source,cpp]
----
include::qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=v]
----

`v` is set to the expression `g`, which means more precisely that `v` is the interpolant of `g` in `Vh`.
======

the variational formulation is implemented below, we define the
bilinear form `a` and linear form `l` and we set _strongly_ the
Dirichlet boundary conditions with the keyword `on` using
elimination. If we don't find `Dirichlet`, `Neumann` or `Robin` in the
list of physical markers in the mesh data structure then we impose
Dirichlet boundary conditions all over the boundary.

[source,cpp]
----
include::qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=vf]
----

[NOTE]
======
We have the following correspondance:

|===
| Element sets  | Domain

| `elements(mesh)` | stem:[\Omega]
| `boundaryfaces(mesh)` | stem:[\partial \Omega]

| `markedfaces(mesh,"Dirichlet")`  |  stem:[\Gamma_D]
| `markedfaces(mesh,"Neumann")`  |  stem:[\Gamma_R]
| `markedfaces(mesh,"Robin")`  |  stem:[\Gamma_R]

|===

======

next we solve the algebraic problem


.Listing: solve algebraic system
[source,cpp]
----
include::qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=solve]
----

next we compute the stem:[L^2] norm of stem:[u_\delta-g], it could
serve as an stem:[L^2] error if stem:[g] was manufactured to be the
exact solution of the <<laplacian>>.

[source,cpp]
----
include::qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=ug]
----

and finally we export the results, by default it is in the ensight
gold format and the files can be read with Paraview and Ensight. We
save both stem:[u] and stem:[g].

== Testcases

The <<implementation>> comes with testcases in 2D and 3D.

=== circle

`circle` is a 2D testcase where stem:[\Omega] is a disk whose boundary
has been split such that stem:[\partial \Omega=\partial \Omega_D \cup
\partial \Omega_N \cup \partial \Omega_R].

Here are some results we can observe after use the following command

[source,bash]
----
cd Testcases/quickstart/circle
mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/bin/feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d --config-file circle.cfg
----

This give us some data such as solution of our problem or the mesh used in the application.

This testcase solves the <<laplacian>> in stem:[\Omega] an quadrangle or hexadra containing the letters of Feel{plus}{plus}
