We will interest now to the different interactions a fluid and a structure can have together with specific conditions. 

== Fluid structure model 

To describe and solve our fluid-structure interaction problem, we need to define a model, which regroup structure model and fluid model parts.

We have then in one hand link:../CFD/README.adoc[the fluid equations], and in the other hand link:../CSM/README.adoc[the structure equations].

The solution of this model are stem:[(\mathcal{A}^t, \boldsymbol{u}_f, p_f, \boldsymbol{\eta}_s)].

== ALE

Generally, the solid mechanic equations are expressed in a Lagrangian frame, and the fluid part in Eulerian frame. To define and take in account the fluid domain displacement, we use a technique name ALE ( Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian ). This allow the flow to follow the fluid-structure interface movements and also permit us to have a different deformation velocity than the fluid one.

Let denote stem:[\Omega^{t_0}] the calculation domain, and stem:[\Omega^t] the deformed domain at time stem:[t]. As explain before, we want to conserve the Lagrangian and Eulerian characteristics of each part, and to do this, we introduce stem:[\mathcal{A}^t] the ALE map.

This map give us the position of stem:[x], a point in the deformed domain at time stem:[t] from the position of stem:[x^*] in the initial configuration stem:[\Omega^*].

stem:[\mathcal{A}^t] is a homeomorphism, i.e. a continuous and bijective application we can define as 

[stem]
++++
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mathcal{A}^t : \Omega^* &\longrightarrow & \Omega^{t} \\
  \mathbf{x}^* &\longmapsto & \mathbf{x} \left(\mathbf{x}^*,t \right)  = \mathcal{A}^t \left(\mathbf{x}^*\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
++++

We denote also  stem:[\forall \mathbf{x}^* \in \Omega^*], the application :

[stem]
++++
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{x} : \left[t_0,t_f \right] &\longrightarrow & \Omega^t \\
t &\longmapsto & \mathbf{x} \left(\mathbf{x}^*,t \right)
\end{eqnarray*}
++++

This ALE map can then be retrieve into the fluid-structure model.
