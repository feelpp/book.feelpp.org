= Turek & Hron CFD Benchmark


== Introduction

We implement the benchmark proposed by link:{biblio}#turek2006proposal[Turek and Hron], on the behavior of drag and lift forces of a flow around an object composed by a pole and a bar, see Figure <<img-geometry1>>.

The software and the numerical results were initially obtained from  link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Vincent Chabannes].

NOTE: This benchmark is linked to the link:../../CSM/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron CSM] and link:../../FSI/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron FSI ] benchmarks.

== Problem Description

We consider a 2D model representative of a laminar incompressible flow around an obstacle. The flow domain, named stem:[\Omega_f], is contained into
the rectangle stem:[ \lbrack 0,2.5 \rbrack \times \lbrack 0,0.41 \rbrack ]. It is characterised, in particular, by its dynamic viscosity stem:[\mu_f] and by its density stem:[\rho_f]. In this case, the fluid material we used is glycerine.

In order to describe the flow, the link:../readme.adoc#_Incompressible_Navier-Stokes_model[ incompressible Navier-Stokes model] is chosen for this case, define by the conservation of momentum equation and the conservation of mass equation. At them, we add the material constitutive equation, that help us to define stem:[\boldsymbol{\sigma}_f]


The goal of this benchmark is to study the behavior of lift forces stem:[F_L] and drag forces stem:[F_D], with three different fluid dynamics applied on the obstacle, i.e on stem:[\Gamma_{obst}], we made rigid by setting specific structure parameters. To simulate these cases, different mean inflow velocities, and thus different Reynolds numbers, will be used.

=== Boundary conditions

We set

* on stem:[\Gamma_{in}], an inflow Dirichlet condition :
 stem:[ \boldsymbol{u}_f=(v_{in},0) ]

* on stem:[\Gamma_{wall}] and stem:[\Gamma_{obst}], a homogeneous Dirichlet condition :
stem:[ \boldsymbol{u}_f=\boldsymbol{0} ]

* on stem:[\Gamma_{out}], a Neumann condition :
stem:[ \boldsymbol{\sigma}_f\boldsymbol{ n }_f=\boldsymbol{0} ]


=== Initial conditions
We use a parabolic velocity profile, in order to describe the flow inlet by stem:[ \Gamma_{in} ], which can be express by

[env.equation]
--
  v_{cst} = 1.5 \bar{U} \frac{4}{0.1681} y \left(0.41-y\right)
--
where stem:[\bar{U}] is the mean inflow velocity.

However, we want to impose a progressive increase of this velocity profile. That's why we define

[env.equation]
--
  v_{in} =
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
   & v_{cst} \frac{1-\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} t \right) }{2}  \quad & \text{ if } t < 2 \\
   & v_{cst}  \quad & \text{ otherwise }
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
--

With t the time.

Moreover, in this case, there is no source term, so stem:[f_f\equiv 0].

== Outputs

As defined above, the goal of this benchmark is to measure the drag and lift forces, stem:[F_D] and stem:[F_L], to control the fluid solver behavior. They can be obtain from

[env.equation]
--
(F_D,F_L)=\int_{\Gamma_{obst}}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_f \boldsymbol{ n }_f
--
where stem:[\boldsymbol{n}_f] the outer unit normal vector from stem:[\partial \Omega_f].

== Discretization

To realize these tests, we made the choice to used stem:[P_N]-stem:[P_{N-1}] Taylor-Hood finite elements, described by link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes], to discretize space. With the time discretization, we use BDF, for Backward Differentation Formulation, schemes at different orders stem:[q].

== Running the model

The configuration files are in `toolboxes/fluid/TurekHron`. The different cases are implemented in the corresponding `.cfg` files e.g. `cfd1.cfg`, `cfd2.cfg` and `cfd3.cfg`.

The command line in feelpp-toolboxes docker reads

.Command line to execute CFD1 testcase
[source,sh]
----
$ mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/bin/feelpp_toolbox_fluid_2d --config-file cfd1.cfg
----

The result files are then stored by default in

.Results Directory
[source,sh]
----
feel/applications/models/fluid/TurekHron/"case_name"/"velocity_space""pression_space""Geometric_order"/"processor_used"
----

For example, for CFD2 case executed on stem:[12] processors, with a stem:[P_2] velocity approximation space, a stem:[P_1] pressure approximation space and a geometric order of stem:[1], the path is

=== CFD3

As CFD3 is time-dependent ( from BDF use ), results will be expressed as

[env.equation]
--
mean ± amplitude [frequency]
--

where

* mean is the average of the min and max values at the last period of oscillations.

[env.equation]
--
mean=\frac{1}{2}(max+min)
--

* amplitude is the difference of the max and the min at the last oscillation.

[env.equation]
--
amplitude=\frac{1}{2}(max-min)
--

* frequency can be obtain by Fourier analysis on periodic data and retrieve the lowest frequency or by the following formula, if we know the period time T.

[env.equation]
--
frequency=\frac{1}{T}
--

== Geometrical Order

NOTE: Add a section on geometrical order.

== Conclusion

The reference results, link:{biblio}#turek2006proposal[Turek and Hron], have been obtained with a time step stem:[\Delta t=0.05]. When we compare our results, with the same step and stem:[\mathrm{BDF}_2], we observe that they are in accordance with the reference results.

With a larger stem:[\Delta t], a discrepancy is observed, in particular for the drag force. It can also be seen at the same time step, with a higher order stem:[\mathrm{BDF}_n] ( _e.g._ stem:[\mathrm{BDF}_3] ). This suggests that the couple stem:[\Delta t=0.05] and stem:[\mathrm{BDF}_2] isn't enough accurate.
