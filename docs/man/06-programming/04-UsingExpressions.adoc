Defining and using expressions
------------------------------
The next step is to construct a function space over the mesh.

=== Step by step explanations

- We start by loading a Mesh in 2D.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/04-myexpression.cpp[tag=mesh]
----

- then we define some expression through the command line of config
  file: `g` is a scalar field and `f` is a vector field, here is an
  example how to enter them :

[source,bash]
----
./feelpp_tut_myexpression --a=3 --functions.g="a*x*y:x:y:a" --functions.f="{sin(pi*x),cos(pi*y)}:x:y"
----

You can print back the expression to the screen to check that
everything is ok. You want to use as expression `a*x+b*y`, you have to
define `a` and `b` as option (either in your code, either in the
library).

- then we compute the gradient of `g` and `f`.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/04-myexpression.cpp[tag=grad]
----

NOTE: template argument are given to `grad` to specify the
shape of the gradient: in the case of stem:[\nabla g], it is stem:[1\times2]
and stem:[2\times 2] for stem:[\nabla f] since we are in 2D.

- then we compute the laplacian of `g`  and `f`.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/04-myexpression.cpp[tag=laplacian]
----

- then we compute the divergence of `f`.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/04-myexpression.cpp[tag=div]
----

- and the curl of `f`

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/04-myexpression.cpp[tag=curl]
----

- Finally we evaluate these expressions at one point given by the option `x` and `y`.

=== Implementation

An implementation reads as follows:
[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/04-myexpression.cpp[tag=all]
----
and the associated config file

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/04-myexpression.cfg[]
----

=== Execution

[source,bash]
----
$ ./feelpp_tut_myexpression
----

or

[source,bash]
----
$ ./feelpp_tut_myexpression --a=3 --functions.g="<your_function>" --functions.f="<your_function>"
----


We start with the following function $$g=1$$ and $$f=(1,1)$$.

[source,bash]
----
 $./feelpp_tut_myexpression --functions.g=1:x:y --functions.f="{1,1}:x:y"
----

and get something like this

[source,bash]
----
g=1
f={1,1}
i=(x-aVal)*y
grad(g)=[[0,0]]
grad(f)=[[0,0],[0,0]]
laplacian(g)=[[0]]
laplacian(f)=[[0],[0]]
div(f)=[[0]]
curl(f)=[[0]]
Evaluation  at  (0,0):
           g(x,y)=1
           f(x,y)=1
1
           i(x,y)=-0
Gradient:
     grad(g)(x,y)=0 0
     grad(f)(x,y)=0 0
0 0
Divergence:
      div(f)(x,y)=0
Curl:
     curl(f)(x,y)=0
Laplacian:
laplacian(g)(x,y)=0
laplacian(f)(x,y)=0
0
----

The symbolic calculus system worked as expected.
