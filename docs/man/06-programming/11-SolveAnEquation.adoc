== Solve a partial differential equation

With all the previously notions we approach, the definition of a
partial differential equation and boundary conditions are our next
step. More details on these aspects can be retrieve at this
link:../07-quickref/forms.adoc[page].


==== Variational formulation

This example refers to a laplacian problem, define by

[[strongform]]
[stem]
.Strong formulation
++++
-\Delta u=1 \text{ in } \Omega=[0,1]^2, \quad u=1 \text{ on } \partial \Omega
++++

After turning the <<strongform>> into its weak form, we have

[stem]
++++
\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \int_\Omega v,\quad u=1 \text{ on } \partial \Omega
++++

where stem:[u] is the unknown and stem:[v] a test function.  The left
side is known as the bilinear form stem:[a] and the right side is the
linear form stem:[l].

[stem]
++++
a(u,v) = l(v), \quad u=1 \text{ on } \partial \Omega
++++

==== Implementation

The steps to implement this problem are

- Loading a 2D mesh, creating the function space stem:[V_h], composed
  of piecewise polynomial functions of order 2, and its associated
  elements

[source,cpp]
----
 auto mesh = loadMesh(_mesh=new Mesh<Simplex<2>>);
 auto Vh = Pch<2>( mesh );
 auto u = Vh->element();
 auto v = Vh->element();
----

- Define the linear form stem:[l] with test function space stem:[V_h]

[source,cpp]
----
auto l = form1( _test=Vh );
l = integrate(_range=elements(mesh),
              _expr=id(v));
----

- Define the bilinear form stem:[a] with stem:[V_h] as test and trial function spaces

[source,cpp]
----
auto a = form2( _trial=Vh, _test=Vh);
a = integrate(_range=elements(mesh),
              _expr=gradt(u)*trans(grad(v)) );
----

`form1` and `form2` are used to define respectively the left and right
side of our partial differential equation.

- Add Dirichlet boundary condition on $$u$$

[source,cpp]
----
a+=on(_range=boundaryfaces(mesh),
      _rhs=l, _element=u, _expr=cst(0.) );
----

We impose, in this case, stem:[u=0] on stem:[\partial\Omega], with the keyword `on`.

- Solving the problem

[source,cpp]
----
a.solve(_rhs=l,_solution=u);
----

- Exporting the solution

[source,cpp]
----
auto e = exporter( _mesh=mesh );
e->add( "u", u );
e->save();
----


The complete code reads as follows :

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/11-mylaplacian.cpp[]
----

and the corresponding config file

[source,cfg]
----
