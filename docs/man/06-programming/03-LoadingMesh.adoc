Loading a Mesh
--------------

The next step is to load a mesh.

The `loadMesh` function has a `_name` option set by default as the
default value of the `--gmsh.filename` option that point either to a
`.geo`, either to a `.msh`, or a `.h5` file. Meshes in general are
more detail into this link:../07-quickref/mesh.adoc#[section].

[source,c++]
----
auto mesh=loadMesh( _mesh=new Mesh<Simplex<2>> );
----

=== Exporting the Mesh for visualisation

See this link:06-VisualizingFunctions.adoc[section] for more details about exporting and visualizing meshes.

=== Implementation

An implementation reads as follows:
[source,c++]
----
include::../../../codes/03-mymesh.cpp[]
----

and the associated config file

[source,cfg]

include::../../../codes/03-mymesh.cfg[]
