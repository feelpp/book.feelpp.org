Evaluating function
-------------------

Once you have created an element, you may want to give it a value,
that can depends on a lot of parameters ( mainly spaces, but others
may apply ).

To do so, Feel++ relies on expressions.
We may use various kind of expressions :

=== Built-in

Let's begin with the evaluation of the expression stem:[sin(\pi x)] on a unit circle.

First at all, we define the unit circle and its link:07-SpaceElements.adoc[function space] :

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/05-myexporter.cpp[tags=meshspace]
----

Then the expression we would like to evaluate :

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/05-myexporter.cpp[tags=expr]
----

`Px()` refers to the variable $$x$$ of our space.

With this,we can `project` it on our function space :

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/05-myexporter.cpp[tags=project]
----

The expression will be evaluated on each point of our mesh.

In order to visualize the result, we create an exporter, named `exhi`, and add to it the projection.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/05-myexporter.cpp[tags=project]
----

==== Code

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/05-myexporter.cpp[tags=all]
----


The list of the Feel++ Keyword is link:../QuickReference/keywords.adoc[here].

=== Hard Coded

In this second method, we will use Functor :

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/myfunctor.cpp[tags=functor]
----

We create a unit square meshed by triangles and we define the associated function space :

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/myfunctor.cpp[tags=meshspace]
----


From this space, we can define two elements, here one equals to the
variable stem:[x] and the other to the variable stem:[y], obtain from
`Functor` class.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/myfunctor.cpp[tags=elements]
----

The data exportation is the final step to visualize our expression stem:[x] and stem:[y] on the defined mesh.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/myfunctor.cpp[tags=exporter]
----

==== Code

The complete code reads as follows

[source,cpp]
----
include::../../../codes/myfunctor.cpp[tags=all]
----

The list of the Feel++ Keyword is <<keywords.adoc,here>>.
