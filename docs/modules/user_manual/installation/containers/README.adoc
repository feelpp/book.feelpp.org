TIP: Difficulty {easy}

The recommended way to start learning {feelpp} consists in using container
technologies. Containers provide an all-in one programming environment to start
directly using {feelpp} skipping the complex installation process.
{feelpp} is provided with two containers solutions currently:

. link:https://www.docker.com/what-docker[Docker]
. link:http://singularity.lbl.gov/about[Singularity]

Depending on your usage and your operating system, you might prefere using one
of these previous solutions. The next sub-sections describe how to obtain
{feelpp} images to begin with {feelpp} programming.

TIP: {feelpp} images provide either a compiling environment with all dependencies,
executables or both.

IMPORTANT: Before going further you might want to install one of the previous
solution.
link:https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/[install docker] or
link:http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-linux[install singularity].



== Docker

Using {feelpp} inside <<what-is-docker,Docker>> is the recommended and fastest
way to use {feelpp}. The <<Docker,Docker chapter>> is dedicated to Docker and
<<feelpp-containers,{feelpp} containers chapter>> is dedicated to {feelpp} in
Docker. We strongly encourage you to follow these steps if you begin with
{feelpp} in particular as an end-user. People who would like to develop with
and in {feelpp} should read through the remaining sections of this chapter.

To begin with {feelpp} using docker, you need first to
link:https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/[install docker] to
have a working docker environment on your machine following the official
documentation with respect to your operating system.  Then choose one of the
{feelpp} images available on the official repository
link:https://hub.docker.com/search/?isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&page=1&pullCount=0&q=feelpp&starCount=0[dockerhub].

We provide currently four main images:

.Table of the current components of the FCS
|===
| Component | Description | Built From

| `feelpp-env` | Execution and Programming environment | <OS>
| `feelpp-libs`  | Feel++ libraries and tools | `feelpp-env`
| `feelpp-base` | Feel++ base applications | `feelpp-libs`
| `feelpp-toolboxes` | Feel++ toolboxes   | `feelpp-toolboxes`

|===

Each image is available with several tags depending on the {feelpp} version,
but also other dependencies.
(link:https://hub.docker.com/r/feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes/tags/[e.g 
toolbox images tag list] )
In most case, you desire to use the `latest` tag.

=== Usage example

Via the commandline and using the {feelpp} toolboxes.  We get the
image and create a new container.

[source, bash]
----
docker pull feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes
docker run -it -v ${HOME}/feel:/feel feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes
----

The `-it` option is used to place yourself inside the container in an interactive mode.
You can start using {feelpp} commands directly.
Note that the `-v` option is used to share a folder between the host and the container.

TIP: Each container can be seen as an instance for the choosen image. 
You can create as many instance as you desire!

It is also possible to execute a {feelpp} application or a command embedded in the container
from the outside. For example

[source, bash]
----
docker run feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes echo "Hello World!"
----

TIP: To keep your data in the container, you can use `docker [start|stop] -i <container name>`.

== Singularity

singularity is another container technology initially developed to work with
HPC infrastructure and solve some security problems in multi-users environment.
Latest link:https://girder.math.unistra.fr/#collections[{feelpp} singularity
images] can be found on link:https://girder.math.unistra.fr/#collections[our
data management server] (recommended) in the {feelpp} collection.  Future
public {feelpp} images will also be available on the official
link:https://singularity-hub.org/[singularity hub] website.  We provide
currently the same main images as for docker, but the suffix naming might vary
depending on the image version.

Singularity works in a similar way as for docker.  For example, you can
download one of the image available on
link:https://girder.math.unistra.fr/#collections[girder] under the collection
`feelpp` -> `singularity_images` -> `ci` -> `feelpp_feelpp-toolboxes-latest.simg`
click on download button.


Once downloaded you can place yourself in the container in interactive as for docker
using the commandline

[source, bash]
----
singularity shell -B ${HOME}/feel:/feel feelpp_feelpp-toolboxes-latest.simg
----

TIP: You can retrieve an image from singularity hub directly
`singularity pull shub://feelpp/singularity:feelpp-toolboxes-latest` instead of girder
and as for docker.
Be aware that current images are currently older than the ones on girder!
