The following typographical conventions are used in the book

_Italic_ indicates new terms

`typewriter` is used on program listings as well as when referring to
programming elements, _e.g._ functions, variables, statements, data types,
environment variables or keywords.

`\$ typewriter` or `> typewriter` displays commands that the user types literally without the `\$` or `>`.

NOTE: this is a general note.

WARNING: this is a general warning.
