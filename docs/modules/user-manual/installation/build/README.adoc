TIP: For beginners, you can skip this section and go directly to <<containers,containers>> section.

Once the steps to install on Linux or MacOS X has been followed, we explain, in this section, how to download and build Feel++ from source.

:leveloffset: +1

:leveloffset: -1

== For the impatient

First retrieve the source
[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp.git
----

Create a build directory
[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
----

Configure Feel++
[source,bash]
----
$ CXX=clang++ ../feelpp/configure -r
----

Compile the Feel++ library 
[source,bash]
----
$ make feelpp
----

TIP: you can speed up the make process by passing the option `-j<N>` where `N` is the number of concurrent `make` sub-processes. It compiles `N` files at a time and respect dependencies. For example `-j4` compiles 4 C++ files at a time. 

WARNING: Be aware that Feel{plus}{plus} consumes memory. The Feel{plus}{plus} library compile with 2Go of RAM. But to be more comfortable, 4Go or more would be best. The more, the better.

Compile your first Feel++ applications
[source,bash]
----
$ make quickstart
----

Execute your first Feel++ application in sequential
[source,sh]
----
$ cd quickstart
$ ./feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d --config-file qs_laplacian_2d.cfg
----


Execute your first Feel++ application using 4 mpi processes
[source,sh]
----
$ mpirun -np 4 feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d --config-file qs_laplacian_2d.cfg
----


== Downloading sources

[[tarballs]]
=== Using Tarballs

Feel++ is distributed as tarballs following each major release. The tarballs are available on the  link:https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp/releases[Feel++ Releases] web page.

Download the latest tarball, then uncompress it with:

[source,sh]
----
$ tar -xzf feelpp-X.YY.0.tar.gz
$ cd feelpp-X.YY.0
----

You can now move to the section <<cmake>>.

[[git]]
=== Using Git

Alternatively, you can download the sources of Feel++ directly from link:https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp[the Git repository].

[source,sh]
----
$ git clone  https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp.git
----

You should read something like
[source,sh]
----

$ cd feelpp

== Configuring Feel++



For now on, we assume that `clang++` has been installed in `/usr/bin`. Yor mileage 
may vary depending on your installation of course.

WARNING: It is not allowed to build the library in the top source directory.

[TIP]
====
It is recommended  to have a directory (e.g. `FEEL`) in which you have
both the sources and build directories, as follows
[source,sh]
----
$ ls FEEL
feelpp/ # Sources
feel.opt/ # Build directory
----
`feelpp` is the top directory where the source have been downloaded, using git or tarballs.
====

[[cmake]]
=== Using cmake

The configuration step with `cmake` is as follows

[source,sh]
----
$ cd FEEL/feel.opt
$ cmake ../feelpp -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++-3.6 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang-3.6 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
----

[NOTE]
====
CMake supports different build type that you can set with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` (case insensitive) :
 * None
 * Debug : typically `-g`
 * Release : typically `-O3 -DNDEBUG`
 * MinSizeRel : typically `-Os`
 * RelWithDebInfo :  typically `-g -O2 -DNDEBUG`
====

=== Using configure

Alternatively you can use the `configure` script which calls `cmake`. `configure --help` will provide the following help.
[source,sh]
.Listing Configure help
----
Options: 
 -b, --build                         build type: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo                                                   
 -d, --debug                         debug mode                             
-rd, --relwithdebinfo                relwithdebinfo mode 
 -r, --release                       release mode  
     --std=c++xx                     c++ standard: c++14, c++1z (default: c++14)                                                   
     --stdlib=libxx                  c++ standard library: stdc++(GCC), c++(CLANG) (default: stdc++)                                  
     --max-order=x                   maximum polynomial order to instantiate(default: 3)                                          
     --cxxflags                      override cxxflags    
     --cmakeflags                    add extra cmake flags 
     --prefix=PATH                   define install path  
 -v, --verbose                       enable verbose output 
 -h, --help                          help page       
     --<package>-dir=PACKAGE_PATH    define <package> install directory   
     --disable-<package>             disable <package>     
     --generator=GENERATOR           cmake generator       
----

We display below a set of possible configurations:

Compile using Release build type, default c++ compiler and libstdc++
[source,sh]
.Listing compiling using default compilers
----
$ ../feelpp/configure -r
----

Compile using Release build type, clang++ compiler and libstdc++
[source,sh]
.Listing compiling using clang++
----
$ CXX=clang++ ../feelpp/configure -r
----

Compile using Debug build type, clang++ compiler and libc++ 
[source,sh]
.Listing compiling using clang++/libc++ in Debug mode
----
CXX=clang++ ../feelpp/configure -d -stdlib=c++
----

== Compiling Feel++

Once `cmake` or `configure` have done their work successfully, you are ready to compile Feel++

[source,bash]
----
$ make
----

You can speed up the compilation process, if you have a multicore processor by specifying the number of parallel jobs `make` will be allowed to spawn  using the `-j` flag:

[source,bash]
.Listing build Feel++ library using 4 concurrent jobs
----
$ make -j4 feelpp
----

NOTE: From now on, all commands should be typed in build directory (e.g `feel.opt`) or its subdirectories.

== Running the Feel++ Testsuite

If you encounter issues with Feel++, you can run the testsuite and send the resulting report. Feel{plus}{plus} has more than 300 tests running daily on our servers. Most of the tests are run both in sequential and in parallel.

The testsuite is in the `testsuite` directory. 
[source,sh]
----
$ cd testsuite
----

The following command will compile 10 tests at a time
[source,sh]
----
$ make -j10
----

.Listing: Running the Feel++ testsuite
[source,bash]
----
$ ctest -j4 -R .
----
It will run 4 tests at a time thanks to the option `-j4`.
