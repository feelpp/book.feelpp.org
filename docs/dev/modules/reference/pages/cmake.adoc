CMake and Feel++ applications
-----------------------------

Feel{plus}{plus} offers a development environment for solving partial
differential equations. It uses many tools to cover the different
steps pre-processing, processing and post-processing and large range
of numerical methods and needs. To this end it is crucial to have a
powerful build environment. Feel{plus}{plus} uses CMake from Kitware and
provides various macros to help setting up your own application or
research project.

=== CMake macros

==== Setting up Feel++ environment

See section link:../GettingStart/using.adoc:[Using Feel++].

==== Adding a new application

See section link:../GettingStart/using.adoc:[Using Feel++].

==== Adding a new testcase

For a give application or multiple applications you may define
testcases. testcases are difrectory containing a set of files that may
include geometry, mesh, cfg or json files.

To define a new testcase case, create a sub-directory where your
application, say `myapp` like in the previous section, stands and copy
the required files there.

[source,bash]
----
cd <source directory of my application>
mkdir mytestcase
# copy files (.geo, .msh, .cfg...) to mytestcase
...
----

then edit the `CMakeLists.txt` in your application directory and add
the following line:

[source,cmake]
----
feelpp_add_testcase(mytestcase)
----

Then type `make feelpp_add_testcase_mytestcase` in the build directory
of your application `myapp`. It will copy in the build directory of
your application the directory mytestcase.

INFO: if you updated the testcase data files, executing `make
feelpp_testcase_mytestcase` will use `rsync` to update the files that
were changed in the source.

The macro `feelpp_add_testcase` supports options:

`PREFIX`:: (default is `feelpp`) set the prefix of the target to avoid eg name clash
[source,cmake]
----
feelpp_add_testcase(mytestcase PREFIX foo)
----
then the target is `foo_add_testcase_mytestcase`.

`DEPS`:: set the dependencies of the testcase
[source,cmake]
----
feelpp_add_testcase(mytestcase DEPS myothertestcase)
----

it allows to update a testcase depending on changes in an other one.
