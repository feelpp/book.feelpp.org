= Post-Processing and Visualization

== Introduction

Once the PDE is solved we usually would like to
visualize the solution and possibly other data or fields associated with the problem. 
{feelpp} provides a very powerful framework for  post-processing allowing to:

 * [x] visualize time-based data,
 * [x] visualize high order functions,
 * [x] visualize traces,
 * [x] use standard visualization tools such as Paraview, Ensight and Gmsh.

To achieve this, {feelpp} defines a so-called `Exporter`  object.

==  General principles

The library {feelpp} itself does not have any visualization capabilities. 
However, it provides tools to export both scalar and vector fields into two formats: `EnSight` and `Gmsh.` 
The {ensight} format can be read by the visualization software http://www.ensight.com[EnSight] or, for instance, by the open source package http://www.paraview.org[Paraview].

The choice of format depends on several factors, some of them being
the robustness/capabilities of the visualization packages associated
and the type of data to be plotted.

For first (at most second) degree piecewise polynomials defined in
straight edge/faces meshes, {paraview} (or any other software that reads
the EnSight format) is a very good choice. A trick to use Paraview (or
any other visualization software that plots first order geometrical
and finite elements) to visualize high degree polynomials in curved
meshes, is to use an interpolation operator built on high order nodes
associated with the polynomial space, see~\cite
gpena_cprudhomme_acomen. However, for high degree polynomials or
meshes with curved elements, http://geuz.org/gmsh[Gmsh] is prefered
due to its adaptive visualization algorithm for this type of
finite/geometrical element.

To illustrate both approaches in visualizing high degree polynomials
in curved meshes, we plot, in the Figures below, the nodal projection
of the function stem:[f(x,y)=\cos(5x) \sin(5y)] in the unit circle onto
several function spaces. 
Notice the improved rendering of the projection using high degree polynomials instead of linear projections
in a finer mesh. 
We remark also that the difference between the two approaches fades away as we increase the degree of the polynomials and the order of the geometrical elements. 
However, the additional cost of building the piecewise first order finite element space associated with the finer mesh, the calculation of the projection onto this space and the smoothness of the graphics makes Gmsh's approach more appealing to visualize this type of finite elements. 
We highlight that these algorithms are available for meshes composed only of simplices or quadrilaterals, in 1D, 2D and 3D.

To further illustrate the capabilities of the Feel's exporter to Gmsh, we plot in Figures 1D and 3D functions defined on the unit sphere.

== Visualization

We would like to visualize the function stem:[u=\sin(\pi x)] over
stem:[\Omega= \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 | x^2 + y^2 < 1 \}]
stem:[\Omega] is approximated by stem:[\Omega_h].

To define stem:[\Omega] and stem:[u] the code reads mesh

[source,cpp]
----
include::{examplesdir}05-myexporter.cpp[tag=exporter]
----

We start with an `Exporter`  object that allows to visualize the stem:[P_1] interpolant of stem:[u] over stem:[\Omega].

== ExporterReference Reference

=== Options

`exporter.format`

  * Type: multiple choice `string`

  * Values: `gmsh` , `ensight` , `ensightgold`

  * Default value: ensightgold

  * Action: `exporter.format`  defines the format to save Feel++ data into.

`exporter.geometry`

  * Type: multiple choice `string`

  * Values: `change_coords_only` , `change` , `static`

  * Default value: change_coords_only

  * Action: `exporter.geometry`  tells to the exporter if the mesh   changes over time steps : no changes (`static)` coordinates     only (`change_coords_only)`  or remeshed (`changes)`

`exporter.fileset`

  * Type: `bool`

  * Values: `0`, `1`

  * Default value: `0`

  * Action: `exporter.fileset`=0 save one file per timestep per
    subdomain, whereas `exporter.fileset`=1 use one file per subdomain
    to store all time steps.

> This option, `exporter.fileset`=1, reduces tremendously the number
  of files generated for transient simulations.

`exporter.prefix`

  * Type: `string`

  * Default Value: `<empty string>`

  * Action: `exporter.prefix` defines the prefix to be user by the
    exporter. It is especially useful when using multiple exporters
    and avoid name collision.

`exporter.directory`

  * Type: `string`

  * Default Value: results

  * Action: `exporter.directory` tells where to export the results

==== Ensight Gold specific options

`exporter.ensightgold.use` -sos

  * Type: `bool`

  * Action: if `exporter.ensightgold.use` -sos=0 multiple case files
    are handle in first case file else the sos file is used to handle
    multiple case files

`exporter.ensightgold.save` -face

  * Type: `bool`

  * Action: if `exporter.ensightgold.save` -face=1, the exporter saves
    mesh and fields on marked faces
