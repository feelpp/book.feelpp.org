== File access options

A big advantage of girder is that files can be accessed either with a nice user
interface (in a web browser) or more programmatically (via CLI or programming
interfaces).
This is true for both upload and download.

=== Web browser UI

If you are new to Girder, you should start with the web user interface to
discover the service.
You are encouraged to read the documentation
link:http://girder.readthedocs.io/[documentation] and especially the
link:http://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-docs.html[user guide].
For example, using a web browser, you can reach
link:https://girder.math.unistra.fr/#collections[our server].

NOTE: This is quite straightforward and it should illustrate important concepts
and help better visualize the following section.

=== Python API

To download or upload a file using python, we have two options.
We can either use a login system (user + password) or an API key.
- With the user/password, we will need to provide a user and a password to
access files, just like a human would do using the UI.
- With an API key, the script only needs an API key.
This means we do not need to have an account on the Girder server.

In both cases, similar pieces of information are required:

- an *address* (URL):  to reach the server,
- a *file ID*: to tell which file/directory we want to manipulate,
- either a *user/password* pair or an *API key*: to grant access to the
required file(s).

=== {feelpp} remotedata tool

The application `feelpp_remotedata` can also be used to upload/download data from Girder, both files and entire folders.
Some examples of its usage follow, and additional information can be found xref:user:using:tools/remotedata.adoc[here].

.Download one file into a specific directory
----
feelpp_remotedata --download "girder:{file:5b1f8707b0e9570499f66bd0}" --data $HOME/mydir
----
.Download one folder
----
feelpp_remotedata --download "girder:{folder:<folder-id>}"
----
.Upload one file/folder (requires authentication)
----
feelpp_remotedata --upload "girder:{folder:<a folder id>}" --data $HOME/mydata
----

A Python interface to these functionalities is also available.

.Download two files from Girder using Python
[source,python]
----
import feelpp as fpp
app = fpp.Environment(["myapp"],config=fpp.localRepository(""))
sm_csv_names = fpp.download( "girder:{file:[<file1-id>,<file2-id>]}", worldComm=app.worldCommPtr())
# It is possible to download an entire folder in zip format
# sm_csv_zipped_folder = fpp.download( "girder:{folder:<folder-id>}", worldComm=app.worldCommPtr())
