= Python scripts

Here, we provide some python scripts to access files on Girder.
To be able to use them, please install the girder client python module (read how
link:http://girder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python-client.html[here].
)

== With user and password

=== What not to do

WARNING: The following script is only meant as a first approach to understand
how the module works.
You should not use it because it requires your password to be written in clear
in the script.
Use the xref:python_scripts.adoc#_interactive_download[interactive version]
instead.

[source, python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3


# We need the girder client module.
import girder_client

# First, we initiate the client with the girder server address.
gc = girder_client.GirderClient(apiUrl='https://girder.math.unistra.fr/api/v1')

# We authenticate using the username and the password.
# /!\ This is for learning purpose.
# For security reasons, you should never put your password in the script.
gc.authenticate(username='USER', password='PASSWORD')   # <1>

# We download the file using its file ID. The path indicates where the file
# should be written (the file name should be included at the end of the path)
gc.downloadFile(fileId='FILEID', path='PATH')           # <2>

----
<1> *USER* should be replaced by the Girder user name,
*PASSWORD* by the corresponding password
<2> *FILEID* should be replaced by the actual Girder file ID and *PATH* should
be the path where to store the results, including the desired file name and
extension.

WARNING: If you don't supply the file name, the system will not warn you, it
will *automatically generate one*, which could be confusing !

IMPORTANT: Remember not to use this script. Try the
xref:python_scripts.adoc#_interactive_download[interactive one] instead.


=== Interactive download

Here, we use a modified version of the _authenticate_ function to use
interactive login.
This means the password will be prompted for at run time.

IMPORTANT: This implies the script can not be used in a fully automated way,
because each execution of the script will require the user of the script to be
present to type the password. For a safe and automatic access, use the
xref:api_keys.adoc#_using_api_keys[API keys].

[source, python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3


# We need the girder client module.
import girder_client

# First, we initiate the client with the girder server address.
gc = girder_client.GirderClient(apiUrl='https://girder.math.unistra.fr/api/v1')

# We authenticate using the username, the password will be typed at runtime
gc.authenticate(username='USER', interactive=True)   # <1>

# We download the file using its file ID. The path indicates where the file
# should be written (the full file name should be included at the end of the path)
gc.downloadFile(fileId='FILEID', path='PATH')        # <2>

----
<1> *USER* should be replaced by the Girder user name, and because of the
_interactive=True_ argument, the password will be prompted for at runtime.
<2> *FILEID* should be replaced by the actual Girder file ID and *PATH* should be the path where to store the results, including the desired file name and extension.

TIP: We can even prompt the user to type *both the user name and the password*
by providing *only* the _interactive=True_ argument !
This is a better solution when multiple users are likely to use the script only
once or a handful of times each.

WARNING: If you don't supply the file name, the system will not warn you, it
will *automatically generate one*, which could be confusing !



=== Interactive upload

To upload a file, only a few changes are required.

[source, python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3


# We need the girder client module.
import girder_client

# First, we initiate the client with the girder server address.
gc = girder_client.GirderClient(apiUrl='https://girder.math.unistra.fr/api/v1')

# We authenticate using the username, the password will be typed at runtime
gc.authenticate(username='USER', interactive=True)    # <1>


# /!\ This is mandatory: we have to open the file in read mode before
# uploading it
f = open('PATH', 'r')                                 # <2>

# Now we can upload the file                            <3>
gc.uploadFile(parentId='PID', stream=f, name="NAME", size=SIZE, parentType='TYPE') 

----

<1> *USER* should be replaced by the Girder user name, and because of the
_interactive=True_ argument, the password will be prompted for at runtime.

<2> *PATH* should be replaced by the full path to the file to read.
*r* stands for "read mode".

<3> *PID* should be replaced by the parent directory ID (on the Girder server).
*f* is the read stream defined previously .
*NAME* should be replaced by the desired file name (on the Girder server).
*SIZE* should be replaced by the file size (in bytes).
*TYPE* is either *folder*, *user*, or *collection*.

NOTE: We should try and find a way to get the file size automatically.
