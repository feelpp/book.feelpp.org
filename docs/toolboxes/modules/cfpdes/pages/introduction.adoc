= Introduction


A lot of PDE(s) can be writen in a generic form, and depends mainly on the definition of coefficients.
The generic form that we use is describe by the next equation :

[stem]
++++
\begin{eqnarray*}
d \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left( -c \nabla u - \alpha u + \gamma \right) + \beta \cdot \nabla u + a u = f \quad \text{ in } \Omega
\end{eqnarray*}
++++

with stem:[u] the unknown and stem:[\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n] the computation domain .
We call this generic form by Coefficient Form PDE and the coefficients are

* stem:[d] : damping or mass coefficient
* stem:[c] : diffusion coefficient
* stem:[\alpha] : conservative flux convection coefficient
* stem:[\gamma] : conservative flux source term
* stem:[\beta] : convection coefficient
* stem:[a] : absorption or reaction coefficient
* stem:[f] : source term

Many problems are multiphysics (i.e. several unknowns) and the generic form can be extended naturally into a system of generic PDE.

NOTE: Coefficients of each equation can be defined by an expression that depends of the current unknown or unknowns of other equations.

The unknown of each PDEs can be defined as a scalar function (stem:[u:\mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}]) or a vectorial function (stem:[u:\mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n]).
We need also to respect some constraint on the coefficient shape as described in the next table.

* Dirichlet : 
* Neumann : generic version which can depend on the unknowns
* Robin : 

== Finite Element Approximation

== Time scheme

* BDF
* Theta

== Stabilized finite element

Given a `cfpdes` equation  named `eq`, SUPG and GaLS can be used as stabilisation methods. 
To enable them use, in the command-line or `.cfg` file, the option `cfpdes.eq.stabilitsation=1` and define the stabilisation type `cfpdes.eq.stabilitsation.type=gls #supg#unusual-gls #gls`
