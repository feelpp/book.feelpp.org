= Fluid Structure Interaction


The Fluid Structure models are formed from the combination of a xref:csm:index.adoc[Solid model] and a xref:cfd:index.adoc[Fluid model].

== Definitions

Let latexmath:[I=[t_i,t_f[] be the time interval, and latexmath:[t\in I] denotes the time.
latexmath:[\Omega^t_f] is the fluid domain, the exponent latexmath:[\phantom{}^t] indicates that the domain changes over time, we work in an Eulerian setting.
We denote latexmath:[\Omega^*_s] the solid wall which is set in a Lagrangian setting.
We also introduce latexmath:[\Omega_f^*] the reference fluid domain, which can
be chosen as latexmath:[\Omega_f^* \equiv \Omega_f^{t_i}] where
latexmath:[t_i] is the initial time.

== ALE Map

To couple the fluid and the solid dynamics, we need to formulate the
fluid equations in Lagrangian coordinates.
To this end, we introduce the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework which allows to go from the Eulerian to the Lagrangian frame and vice versa, and more specifically we define the ALE map.

This map give us the position of stem:[x], a point in the deformed domain at time stem:[t] from the position of stem:[x^*] in the initial configuration stem:[\Omega^*]. Figure <<img-geometry2,1>> displays a schematic of the fluid structure interaction (FSI) and the action of the ALE map latexmath:[\mathcal{A}_{}^t].

stem:[\mathcal{A}^t] is a homeomorphism, i.e. a continuous and bijective application we can define as
[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{A}_{}^t:\: & \Omega_f^* & \rightarrow && \Omega_f^t \\
    & \mathbf{x}^* & \mapsto && \mathbf{x} = \mathcal{A}^t \left(\mathbf{x}^*\right)
  \end{aligned}
++++
where latexmath:[\mathbf{x}] is the position in
latexmath:[\Omega_f^t] of the point which was at
latexmath:[\mathbf{x}^*] in latexmath:[\Omega_f^*].

We denote also  stem:[\forall \mathbf{x}^* \in \Omega^*], the application :

[stem]
++++
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{x} : \left[t_i,t_f \right] &\longrightarrow & \Omega^t \\
t &\longmapsto & \mathbf{x} \left(\mathbf{x}^*,t \right)
\end{eqnarray*}
++++

We can then define the Lagrangian derivative
[stem]
++++
{\left. \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} \right |_{\mathbf{x}^*}} = {\left. \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} \right |_{\mathbf{x}}} +   \left( \boldsymbol{w} \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \right) \boldsymbol{u}
++++

where latexmath:[\boldsymbol{u}] is a vector field and
latexmath:[\boldsymbol{w}] is the velocity of the mesh displacement
defined as follows
[stem]
++++
\boldsymbol{w} \left(\mathbf{x},t\right) %=    \aleTimeDer{\coord{x}} \left(\coord{x},t\right)
  = \frac{\partial \mathbf{x} }{\partial t} \left( \left(\mathcal{A}_{}^t\right)^{-1} \left(\mathbf{x}\right),t\right)     %  \aleTimeDer{\ale{}^{t}}  % \frac{\partial \ale{}^{t}}{\partial t}
++++
Variables defined in the reference frame are denoted as follows
latexmath:[\hat{\boldsymbol{u}} = \boldsymbol{u} \circ \mathcal{A}_{}^t]

And finally we denote
[stem]
++++
\boldsymbol{F}_{\mathcal{A}_f^t} = \boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}^* + \nabla \mathcal{A}_f^t
++++
and
[stem]
++++
J_{\mathcal{A}_f^t} = det(\boldsymbol{F}_{\mathcal{A}_f^t})
++++

Consider a laminar incompressible flow, the velocity and pressure latexmath:[(\boldsymbol{u}_f,p_f)] are
then given by the equations
[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
    \begin{aligned}
        \rho_{f} {\left. \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}_f}{\partial t} \right |_{\mathbf{x}}}
        + \rho_{f} \left( \left(\boldsymbol{u}_{f}- \boldsymbol{w}_f\right) \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \right) \boldsymbol{u}_{f}
        - \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{f} &= \boldsymbol{f}^t_f , \quad \text{ in } \Omega^t_f\\ % \times \left[t_i,t_f \right] \\
        \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}_{f} &= 0 , \quad \text{ in } \Omega^t_f % \times \left[t_i,t_f \right]
    \end{aligned}\end{aligned}
++++
with
[stem]
++++
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{f} = -p_f \boldsymbol{I} + 2 \mu_f \boldsymbol{D}\left(\boldsymbol{u}_{f}\right)
++++
and
[stem]
++++
\boldsymbol{D}\left(\boldsymbol{u}_{f}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left( \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \boldsymbol{u}_{f} + \left( \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \boldsymbol{u}_{f} \right)^{T} \right)
++++
and where latexmath:[$\boldsymbol{f}_t$] is the volumic force density, latexmath:[\rho_f] the blood density and latexmath:[\mu_f] the blood viscosity.

Consider now a nearly incompressible hyperelastic structure.
We use, in this case, a displacement-pressure formulation following a Saint Venant-Kirchhoff material law.
The displacement and pressure latexmath:[(\boldsymbol{\eta}_s, p_s)] equations read:
[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
    \rho^*_{s} \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\eta}_s}{\partial t^2}
    - \nabla \cdot \left(\boldsymbol{F}_s \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_s\right)
    &=&    \boldsymbol{f}^t_s \quad \text{ in } \Omega^*_s \\
    tr\left(\boldsymbol{E}_s\right) &=& \frac{1}{\lambda} p_s \quad \text{ in } \Omega^*_s
  \end{aligned}\]] with latexmath:[\[\begin{aligned}
    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_s&=& -p_s \mathbb{I} + 2 \mu_s \boldsymbol{E}_s \\
    \boldsymbol{E}_s &=&
    \frac{1}{2} \left( \nabla \boldsymbol{\eta}_s + \left(\nabla \boldsymbol{\eta}_s\right)^{T} \right)
  + \frac{1}{2} \left(\left(\nabla \boldsymbol{\eta}_s\right)^{T} \nabla \boldsymbol{\eta}_s \right)
  \end{aligned}
++++
where latexmath:[\lambda_s], latexmath:[\mu_s] are the Lamé coefficients
defined as
latexmath:[\lambda_s = \frac{E_s \nu_s}{ (1+\nu_s)(1-2\nu_s)} \quad , \quad \mu_s = \frac{E_s}{2(1+\nu_s)},]
latexmath:[\rho_s (\textrm{ kg}\,\textrm{mm}^3)] is
the structure density, latexmath:[E_s (\textrm{ kg}\,\textrm{mm}^{-1}\,\textrm{s}^{-2})] is the Young modulus and latexmath:[nu_s] is the Poisson coefficient.

The solution of this model are stem:[(\mathcal{A}^t, \boldsymbol{u}_f, p_f, \boldsymbol{\eta}_s)].

== Coupling conditions

In order to have a complete fluid-structure model, we need to add to the solid model and the fluid model equations some coupling conditions :

[stem]
++++
  \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\eta_{s}} }{\partial t} - \boldsymbol{u}_f \circ \mathcal{A}_{f}^t
  = \boldsymbol{0} , \quad \text{ on } \Gamma_{fsi}^* \times \left[t_i,t_f \right] \quad \boldsymbol{(1)}
++++

[stem]
++++
  \boldsymbol{F}_{s} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{s} \boldsymbol{n}^*_s + J_{\mathcal{A}_{f}^t} \hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_f \boldsymbol{F}_{\mathcal{A}_{f}^t}^{-T} \boldsymbol{n}^*_f
  = \boldsymbol{0} , \quad \text{ on } \Gamma_{fsi}^* \times \left[t_i,t_f \right] \quad \boldsymbol{(2)}
++++

[stem]
++++
  \boldsymbol{\varphi}_s^t  - \mathcal{A}_{f}^t = \boldsymbol{0} , \quad \text{ on } \Gamma_{fsi}^* \times \left[t_i,t_f \right] \quad \boldsymbol{(3)}
++++

stem:[\boldsymbol{(1)}, \boldsymbol{(2)}, \boldsymbol{(3)}] are the fluid-struture coupling conditions, respectively velocities continuity, constraint continuity and geometric continuity.

=== Fluid structure coupling conditions with 1D reduced model

In the case of a 2D fluid and 1D structure, we need to modify the original ones stem:[\boldsymbol{(1)},\boldsymbol{(2)}, \boldsymbol{(3)}] by

[stem]
++++
\dot{\eta}_s \boldsymbol{e}_r - \boldsymbol{u}_f = \boldsymbol{0} \quad \boldsymbol{(1.2)}
++++

[stem]
++++
f_s  + \left(J_{\mathcal{A}_f^t} \boldsymbol{F}_{\mathcal{A}_f^t}^{-T} \hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_f \boldsymbol{n}^*_f\right) \cdot \boldsymbol{e}_r
=  0 \quad \boldsymbol{(2.2)}
++++

[stem]
++++
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_s^t  - \mathcal{A}_f^t = \boldsymbol{0} \quad \boldsymbol{(3.2)}
++++

== Discretization

Regarding the space discretization, we use the finite element method to
discretize the model described above.
We use continuous piecewise polynomials of order stem:[k+1] for the velocity and order stem:[k] for the pressure in the fluid and we use continuous piecewise polynomials of order stem:[k] for the displacement.

NOTE: The ALE map would be descretized with the same polynomial order as the displacement.

Regarding the time discretization, we can use for the fluid a stem:[BDF_2] scheme
and for the solid we use the Newmark scheme, both are second order in
time.

The algebraic representation of the fluid and solid model are solved
using iterative methods preconditioned with algebraic-factorization type
preconditioners enabling fast solves. The fluid-structure interaction
coupling is handled with a Picard method that iterates between the fluid
and the solid models until the relative increment between two non-linear
iterations reaches a given tolerance.

The FSI solution strategy follows a partitioned method solving at time
latexmath:[t^n] alternatively for the solid displacement
latexmath:[\boldsymbol{\eta}_s^n] and then the fluid velocity and
pressure latexmath:[\boldsymbol{u}_f^{n}, p_f^n] until convergence.

Different coupling strategies (semi-implicit and semi-explicit) can be set between  fluid and the structure:

* using a Dirichlet-Neumann scheme
* using a Robin-Robin coupling scheme between the fluid and the structure.
* using a Generalized Robin-Neumann scheme

NOTE: The list needs to be updated

== Coupling strategies

Discrete coupling conditions must mimic the continuous coupling conditions that impose velocity, stress and geometric continuity on the FSI interface.

FSI coupling conditions can be practically enforced in different ways. A key element determining the numerical scheme to be used is the added-mass effect. This phenomenon depends on the ratio stem:[\frac{\rho_s}{\rho_f}] and refers to the different acceleration that a body immersed in a fluid experiences, as opposed to the acceleration it would experience in vacuum. This effect is explained by imagining that, as it moves, the solid carries with it a certain volume of fluid, and the higher the fluid density, the stronger the added mass. The added-mass effect is strong when fluid and solid densities are approximately equal.

Initially, when FSI simulations were carried out for aerodynamic purposes, this effect was negligible and a Dirichlet-Neumann approach was employed; lately, FSI modeling started employing denser fluids, and numerical schemes that are independent from added mass effects became necessary: two examples are Robin-Robin and Generalized Robin-Neumann schemes. They are all explicit schemes.

=== Dirichlet-Neumann

Dirichlet-Neumann coupling strategy is the easiest and directest one. It discretizes the FSI coupling conditions as follows: at the stem:[n]-th time iteration, on the fluid sub-problem the following conditions are imposed

[stem]
++++

\mathbf{u}_f^n = \frac{\boldsymbol{\eta}_s^{n-1} - \boldsymbol{\eta}_s^{n-2}}{\Delta t} \quad \textrm{in stem:[\Omega_f^t]}

++++

They are the discretized Dirichlet prescription on the velocity suggested by the coupling conditions.

On the solid sub-problem, instead, the Neumann condition on the stresses' continuity is imposed in a discrete form
[stem]
++++
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_s^n \mathbf{n}_s = -\boldsymbol{\sigma}_f^n \mathbf{n}_f \quad \textrm{in stem:[\Omega_s^*]}
++++

=== Robin-Robin

Robin-Robin (RR) coupling strategy imposes coupling conditions in Robin form, in two steps: at the stem:[n]-th time iteration, on the solid sub-problem the following conditions are imposed
[stem]
++++
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_s^n\mathbf{n}_s + \frac{\gamma \mu_f}{h} \mathbf{u}_s^n = \frac{\gamma \mu_f}{h} \mathbf{u}_f^{n-1}- \boldsymbol{\sigma}_f^{n-1}\mathbf{n_f} \quad \textrm{in stem:[\Omega_s^*]}
++++
where
[stem]
++++
\mathbf{u}_s^n= \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\eta}_s^n}{\partial t}
++++
The right-hand side depends only on quantities coming from the stem:[(n-1)]-th time iteration.

Once the solid sub-problem has been solved, one uses stem:[\mathbf{u}_s^n ] to impose on the fluid sub-problem:
[stem]
++++
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_f^n\mathbf{n}_f + \frac{\gamma \mu_f}{h} \mathbf{u}_f^n = \frac{\gamma \mu_f}{h} \mathbf{u}_s^{n} +\boldsymbol{\sigma}_f^{n-1} \mathbf{n_f} \quad \textrm{in stem:[\Omega_f^t]}
++++
Here, stem:[\gamma] is a penalization parameter to be chosen.

It should be noticed that in (RR) stability and accuracy are subject to a CFL-condition: hyperbolic-type CFL, for which stem:[\Delta t = \mathcal{O}(h)], is sufficient to have stability, but parabolic-type CFL, for which stem:[\Delta t = \mathcal{O}(h^2)], is necessary to have optimal accuracy.

=== Generalized Robin-Neumann

This coupling strategy, at the stem:[n]-th time iteration, imposes on the fluid sub-problem:
[stem]
++++
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_f^n \mathbf{n} + \frac{\rho_s}{\Delta t} \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u}_f^n = \frac{\rho_s}{\Delta t} \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u}_s^{n-1} - \boldsymbol{\sigma}_s^{n-1}\mathbf{n}_s \quad \textrm{in stem:[\Omega_f^t]}
++++
where
[stem]
++++
\mathbf{u}_s^{n-1}= \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\eta}_s^{n-1}}{\partial t}
++++
and stem:[\mathbf{B}] is a self-adjoint operator coming from a mass lumping procedure. The fluid-sided condition is called generalized Robin because of stem:[\bf{B}] that multiplies fluid and solid velocities.

On the solid sub-problem, the following discrete Neumann condition is imposed
\[
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_s^n \mathbf{n}_s = -\boldsymbol{\sigma}_f^n \mathbf{n}_f \quad \textrm{in stem:[\Omega_s^*]}
\]
Also in this case there are CFL-type constraints that link space and time discretization steps: under parabolic-type CFL condition, stability is guaranteed; however, if adequate extrapolation techniques are employed, stability can be obtained under weaker requirements.
