= Computational Fluid Dynamics

Welcome to the Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) toolbox.
This module explains how to use the Laminar Flow interface to model and simulate fluid mechanics for laminar, incompressible fluids.

NOTE: The engineering community often uses the term CFD, computational fluid dynamics, to refer to the numerical simulation of fluids.

== Features

* 2D and 3D
* Stokes flows
