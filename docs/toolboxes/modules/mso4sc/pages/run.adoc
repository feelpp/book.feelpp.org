TIP: when running into some strange portal behavior, first try to `logout/login` from the portal before reporting an issue.


[[purchase]]
== Purchase a {feelpp} application

To purchase an application from the *Marketplace* you have to be registered and logged in as a *EndUser* at least.

The process is the following:

* connect to the link:{uri-msoportal-www}[*Marketplace*], in *Home* (top left Marketplace page) you will find all available apps (*All categories*).
* Click on *Add to Cart* to purchase the app you want.
* Click on *Shopping Cart* and *Checkout* to go on
** fill the required forms for *shipping address*
** provide a *shipping address* if not already defined
** provide a *billing address* if not already defined
** Finalize your order by clicking on *Checkout*

To use the app, you will have to wait that the owner/seller of the app validate
you order. To check the status of your order:

* go to *My Inventory*
* go to *Product Orders*

You shall be able to see your products and their status in each product form.

NOTE: The Marketplace is not available anymore, for technical reasons. For now, all the registered applications can be used in the *Experiments* section. 



[[data]]
== Benchmarks and Examples Catalogue

Go to the xref:cases:ROOT:index.adoc[{feelpp} Case Studies guide] to discover examples and benchmarks for the different {feelpp} applications.

[[running]]
== Running an {feelpp} application in *Experiments*

* In the *Experiments* tab :
** Select *Instances*
** select a registered app in the menu

At this point you should have a page with all the options that need to be filled before creating the instance.

.Example of interface of the {feelpp} CFD app
image::Portal_FeelppCFDApp2.png[]

The interface above is commun to all the toolbox applications. For each application, default parameters are filled and sould work right away. 
The only mandatory field to fill is the ID. This ID will be used to identify the instance once it is deployed.

We detail the different field in the following tables. We differentiate the keys specs to run the simulation and the key specs to define the HPC settings.

.List of keys specs for running simulations
[options="header,footer"]
|===
| Key                           | Description                                 | Default                                                            | Notes
| **feelpp_<toolbox>_case**   | string that describe the location of the testcase      | Depending on the toolbox |A default test-case is proposed but more are availbe in the Feel/toolbox repository                       |
| **feelpp_<toolbox slug name>_cli**     | command line options       |  "" | For advanced usage only
|===

.List of keys to be defined for HPC settings
[options="header,footer"]
|===
| Key                        | Description              | Default          | Notes
| **job_max_time** | maximum allowed time for run (minutes and seconds) | '00:30:00' |  depends on batch system and selected `job_partition`
| **job_partition** | partition to be used on the supercomputer | `thin-shared` |  depends on HPC system

| **job_tasks** | number of tasks to be used in parallel | 4 |  shall depends on batch system and selected partition

|===

Once the fields are filled, you can click on *Create new Instance*. Your application is now in the menu belove with the list of the *App's Instance*. You can select your application using the right ID and *Run!* it.

At this point you will see the simplified logs of the deployement and execution process.
Depending on the application and the HPC availability, this step may takes some minutes to be performed. The button will indicate the status of the running process :
 
* Blue: on going 
* Red: error
* Green: application finished successfully. 

Once the running process is over you can destroy the current instance and move to the visualization section.

== Setting up an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to {uri-msoportal-visu-www}[*Visualization*]
* Select *Settings*
* Define a Remote Desktop resource

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/remotedesktop.txt[]
----

=== Using Paraview with a Remote Desktop
* Go to *Visualization*
* Click *Desktop Available*
** Select your *Infrastructure* in the sliding menu
** Click on *Create*
** Click either on *Desktop* or *View Only*

[NOTE]: if no *Remote desktop* is defined, you will receive a warning message. Create a <<post, *Setting*>>, then go back to this step.

It opens a new web page within your browser. You can now start visualization tolls such as paraview or ensight. Here is the procedure to start paraview, for more information on paraview see link:{https://www.paraview.org/documentation/}[*paraview documentation*]. 

* start a terminal (second icone in the top left corner)
* load paraview module 
----
$ module load ParaView/5.2.0
----
* go to the directory where the data are stored. For Feelpp applications, the data are usually stored in `$LUSTRE/mso4sc_orchestrator/<instance_name>/`
* once you are in the proper repository, you can load your data with paraview
----
$ paraview Export.case
