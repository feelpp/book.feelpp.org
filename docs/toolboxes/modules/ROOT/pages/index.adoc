= {feelpp} for Multiphysics Modeling and Simulation

Welcome to the documentation of the {feelpp} Toolboxes.

== Introduction

{feelpp} provides a  powerful  environment for modeling and solving various kinds of scientific and engineering problems.
The framework provides a powerful language to describe these models.
With {feelpp} toolboxes, you can extend conventional models for one type of physics into multiphysics models that solve coupled physics phenomena.
It does not require an in-depth knowledge of mathematics or numerical analysis, they are hidden with the toolboxes.
Using the xref:what-is-a-toolbox.adoc#_json_files[JSON] and xref:what-is-a-toolbox.adoc#_cfg_files[CFG], it is possible to configure and run models by defining the relevant physical quantitiesâ€”such as material properties, loads, constraints, sources, and fluxes.

Using these physics interfaces, you can perform various types of studies including:

* [x] Stationary and time-dependent (transient) studies
* [x] Linear and nonlinear studies

When solving the models, {feelpp} Toolboxes uses the standard Galerkin method, eg the proven Finite element method but more advanced methods sur as HDG methods are available. The software runs the finite element analysis using a variety of numerical solvers.
The studies can make use of multiprocessor systems and cluster computing and run from a one core to thousands of cores seamlessly.
A more detailed description of the mathematical and numerical foundation is available in  xref:math:ROOT:index.adoc[Mathematics of {feelpp}].

To start using our toolboxes, read:

* [x] xref:what-is-a-toolbox.adoc[What is a Toolbox] to understand what we mean by toolbox and how you can configure and run our toolboxes.

Next, you can access the documentation our toolboxes as well as case studies:

* [x] some theoretical aspects
* [x] a reference guide regarding the toolbox configuration of the xref:what-is-a-toolbox.adoc#_json_files[JSON files].
* [x] Cases studies are available in the xref:cases:ROOT:index.adoc[Toolbox Benchmarks Guide].
