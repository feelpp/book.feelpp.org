= Electrostatics toolbox

Welcome to the Electrostatics toolbox.

The Electrostatics toolbox solves a charge conservation equation for the electric potential given the spatial distribution of the electric charge.
It is used to model charge conservation under static conditions.
It is often coupled in our applications with the xref:toolbox:thermoelectric[Heat Transfert toolbox] to model joule heating.
