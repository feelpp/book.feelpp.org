= ElectroMagnetism


Electromagnetic field  problems can be characterized by the field intensities and the flux densities described by the partial differential equations derived from Maxwell’s equations.

Maxwell’s equations define relations for the electromagnetic field quantities and the source elements, i.e. the electric and the magnetic field intensities, the electric and the magnetic flux densities, the charge and current distribution. Constitutive relations are added to Maxwell’s equations to describe the properties of the media.
