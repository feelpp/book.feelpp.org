== Description

Based on the solution of the stationary heat equation, we create a reduced order model for the simulation of heat exchanges in a 3D building. 

The building is composed of a corridor and 5 rooms, each of which contains a heating unit. Internal walls and doors are modelled as having finite thickness, while external walls properties (thickness and insulation) are encoded in the boundary conditions of the problem.

=== Mathematical model

Let stem:[\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3] be the region occupied by the building, and denote stem:[\Omega_i], stem:[i=0,1,2] its subregions occupied by the air, the internal walls and the internal doors, such that stem:[\Omega = \cup_{i=0}^2 \Omega_i]. Let stem:[k_i] be the thermal conductivities associated with the subregions.

The external boundary of the domain stem:[\partial \Omega] is decomposed into two parts: stem:[\partial \Omega_{ext}], which corresponds to external walls, and stem:[\partial \Omega_D] which corresponds to the front door. We denote by stem:[\Gamma_i] the boundary of the stem:[i-]th heating unit, stem:[i=0,...,4]. The problem writes as

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
- \nabla \cdot (k_i\nabla u) &= 0, \quad &\text{on }\Omega_i \\
u &= \mu_i \quad &\text{on }\Gamma_i, i=0,...,4, \\
-  k_0 \nabla u \cdot \vec{n} &= \mu_6 (u - \mu_5), \quad &\text{on }\partial \Omega_{ext},\\
-  k_0 \nabla u \cdot \vec{n} &= \sigma (u - \mu_5), \quad &\text{on }\partial \Omega_{D}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
++++
where stem:[\sigma] is the convective heat exchange coefficient associated with the front door.

The parameters stem:[\mu_i] correspond to 

* stem:[\mu_i \in (300,340)], for stem:[i=0,...,4], are the surface temperatures of the heating units (in Kelvin);
* stem:[\mu_5 \in (270,290)] is the external temperature (in Kelvin);
* stem:[\mu_6] is a function of the external wall thickness. The wall is composed of two layers: a cinder layer of thickness stem:[l_{cinder} \in (0.1,0.3) m] and an insulation layer of thickness stem:[l_{insulation} \in (0.1,0.2) m], and

[stem]
++++
\mu_6 = \frac{1}{0.06 + \frac{0.01}{0.5} + \frac{l_{cinder}}{0.8} + \frac{l_{insulation}}{0.032} + \frac{0.016}{0.313} + 0.14}.

=== Construction of the affine decomposition

The problem presents an affine dependence on the parameters, hence we can explicity compute the terms of the correspondent affine decomposition

[stem]
++++
\sum_{i = 0}^{N_A} \theta^A_i(\mu) A_i(u,v) = \sum_{j = 0}^{N_F} \theta^F_j(\mu) F_j(v),
++++
where stem:[N_A = 1] and stem:[N_F = 6].

The first product on the left-hand side is given by stem:[\theta^A_0(\mu) = 1] and 

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A_0(u,v) &= \sum_{i=0}^{N_m} \int_{\Omega_i} k_i \nabla u \cdot \nabla v + \\
 & - \int_{\partial \Omega_{ext}} k_0 (\nabla u v + \nabla v u )\cdot \vec{n} +  \\
 & + \int_{\partial \Omega_{ext}} k_0 \frac{\gamma}{h} u v  +\\
 & + \int_{\partial \Omega_D} uv, 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
++++ 

where stem:[\gamma] is the Nitsche penalty parameter and stem:[h] is the local mesh size.

The second product is given by stem:[\theta^A_1(\mu) = \mu_6] and

[stem]
++++
A_1(u,v) = \int_{\partial \Omega_{ext}} u v.
++++

The terms on the right-hand side are stem:[\theta^F_i(\mu) = \mu_i] for stem:[i=0,...,4], corresponding to the temperatures of the heating units, stem:[\theta^F_5(\mu) = \mu_5\mu_6], corresponding to the temperature on the internal surface of the external walls, and stem:[\theta^F_6(\mu) = \mu_5], corresponding to the external temperature. The corresponding linear forms are 

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
F_i (v) &= k_0 \int_{\Gamma_i} -\nabla v \cdot \vec{n} + \frac{\gamma}{h} v, \quad i = 0,...,4\\
F_5 (v) &= \int_{\partial \Omega_{ext}} v,\\
F_6 (v) &= \int_{\partial \Omega_D} \sigma v.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
++++

== Output

The output corresponds to the air mean temperature, and it is computed as

\begin{equation}
s(\mu) = \frac{1}{|\Omega_0|} \int_{\Omega_0} u.

== Running the case using a Jupyter notebook

It is possible to download this page as a Jupyter notebook and run it in an environment that contains a local installation of {feelpp} and its Python wrappers. The offline creation of the reduced basis has already been performed, and an archive is downloaded from Girder. It contains the basis, the model and the configuration files that are necessary for the online simulation.
