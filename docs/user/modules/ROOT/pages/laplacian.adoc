= Laplacian
:path-quickstart: /feel/testcases/quickstart

We are interested in this section in the _conforming finite element approximation_ of the following problem:

[[laplacian]]
.Laplacian problem
****
Look for stem:[u] such that

[stem]
++++
\left\{\begin{split}                                                                                                                                              -\Delta u &= f \text{ in } \Omega\\                                                                                                                           u &= g \text{ on } \partial \Omega_D\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &=h \text{ on } \partial \Omega_N\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + u &=l \text{ on } \partial \Omega_R
 \end{split}\right.
++++
****

CAUTION: stem:[\partial \Omega_D], stem:[\partial \Omega_N] and stem:[\partial \Omega_R] can be empty sets. In the case stem:[\partial \Omega_D =\partial \Omega_R = \emptyset], then the solution is known up to a constant.

NOTE: Hereafter, we note stem:[\Gamma_D=\partial \Omega_D], stem:[\Gamma_N=\partial \Omega_N] and stem:[\Gamma_R=\partial \Omega_R].

[NOTE]
======
In the implementation presented later, stem:[\partial \Omega_D =\partial \Omega_N = \partial \Omega_R = \emptyset], then we set Dirichlet boundary conditions all over the boundary. The problem then reads like a standard laplacian with inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions:

.Laplacian Problem with inhomogeneous Dirichlet conditions
****
Look for stem:[u] such that

[stem]
.Inhomogeneous Dirichlet Laplacian problem
++++
-\Delta u = f\ \text{ in } \Omega,\quad u = g \text{ on } \partial \Omega
++++
****
======


== Variational formulation

We assume that stem:[f, h, l \in L^2(\Omega)]. The weak formulation of the problem then reads:

.Laplacian problem variational formulation
****
Look for stem:[u \in H^1_{g,\Gamma_D}(\Omega)] such that

[stem]
.Variational formulation
++++
\displaystyle\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v +\int_{\Gamma_R} u v = \displaystyle \int_\Omega f\ v+ \int_{\Gamma_N} g\ v + \int_{\Gamma_R} l\ v,\quad \forall v \in H^1_{0,\Gamma_D}(\Omega)
++++
****

== Conforming Approximation

We now turn to the finite element approximation using Lagrange finite
element. We assume stem:[\Omega] to be a segment in 1D, a polygon in
2D or a polyhedron in 3D.  We denote stem:[V_\delta \subset
H^1(\Omega)] an approximation space such that stem:[V_{g,\delta}
\equiv P^k_{c,\delta}\cap H^1_{g,\Gamma_D}(\Omega)].

The weak formulation reads:

.Laplacian problem weak formulation
****
Look for stem:[u_\delta \in V_\delta  ] such that

[stem]
++++
\displaystyle\int_{\Omega_\delta} \nabla u_{\delta} \cdot \nabla v_\delta +\int_{\Gamma_{R,\delta}} u_\delta\ v_\delta = \displaystyle \int_{\Omega_\delta} f\ v_\delta+ \int_{\Gamma_{N,\delta}} g\ v_\delta + \int_{\Gamma_{R,\delta}} l\ v_\delta,\quad \forall v_\delta \in V_{0,\delta}
++++
****

NOTE: from now on, we omit stem:[\delta] to lighten the notations. Be
careful that it appears both the geometrical and approximation level.



[[implementation]]
== Feel++ Implementation

In Feel{plus}{plus},  stem:[V_{g,\delta}] is not built but rather
stem:[P^k_{c,\delta}].

NOTE: The Dirichlet boundary conditions can be treated using different techniques and we use from now on the elimination technique.

We start with the mesh

[source,cpp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/laplacian/qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=mesh]
----
//include::{uri-github-feelpp}/quickstart/qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=mesh]

NOTE: the keyword `auto` enables type inference, for more details see link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Type_inference[Wikipedia C{plus}{plus}11 page].

[source,cpp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/laplacian/qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=discr]
----
Next we define

<1> the discrete space `Vh=Pch<k>(mesh)` stem:[\equiv P^k_{c,h}],
<2> an element `u` of `Vh`
<3> an expression `mu` that is used as the diffusion coefficient
<4> an expression `f` that is used for the right hand-side term in the equation
<5> an expression `r_1` that is used for the first term in the Robin boundary condition
<6> an expression `r_2` that is used for the first term in the Robin boundary condition
<7> an expression `n` that is used to define the Neumann boundary condition
<8> an expression `solution` that is used to define the exact solution if there is one
<9> an expression `g` that is used to define the Dirichlet boundary condition.

[NOTE]
======
at the following line

[source,cpp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/laplacian/qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=v]
----

`v` is set to the expression `g`, which means more precisely that `v` is the interpolant of `g` in `Vh`, _i.e_ we write stem:[v=\Pi^k_{c,\delta} g] with stem:[v \in P^k_{c,\delta}].
======

the variational formulation is implemented below, we define the
bilinear form `a` and linear form `l` and we set _strongly_ the
Dirichlet boundary conditions with the keyword `on` using
elimination. If we don't find `Dirichlet`, `Neumann` or `Robin` in the
list of physical markers in the mesh data structure then we impose
Dirichlet boundary conditions all over the boundary.

[source,cpp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/laplacian/qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=vf]
----

[NOTE]
======
We have the following correspondence:

|===
| Element sets  | Domain

| `elements(mesh)` | stem:[\Omega]
| `boundaryfaces(mesh)` | stem:[\partial \Omega]

| `markedfaces(mesh,"Dirichlet")`  |  stem:[\Gamma_D]
| `markedfaces(mesh,"Neumann")`  |  stem:[\Gamma_R]
| `markedfaces(mesh,"Robin")`  |  stem:[\Gamma_R]

|===
More details can be found in xref:dev:reference:Keywords/keywords.adoc[Mathematical keywords] of {feelpp} and the xref:dev:referrence:Mesh/README.adoc[Mesh] reference.
======

next we solve the algebraic problem


.Listing: solve algebraic system
[source,cpp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/laplacian/qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=solve]
----

next we compute the stem:[L^2] norm of stem:[u_\delta-g], it could
serve as an stem:[L^2] error if stem:[g] was manufactured to be the
exact solution of the <<laplacian>>.

[source,cpp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/laplacian/qs_laplacian.cpp[tag=ug]
----

and finally we export the results, by default it is in the ensight
gold format and the files can be read with Paraview and Ensight. We
save both stem:[u] and stem:[g].

== Test Cases

We are now ready to test this Laplacian <<implementation>> with 2D and 3D test cases.

IMPORTANT: The test cases are available in Docker in the directory (`{path-quickstart}/laplacian`).

=== Circle

`Circle` is a 2D testcase where stem:[\Omega \subset \RR^2] is a disk whose boundary
has been split such that stem:[\partial \Omega=\partial \Omega_D \cup
\partial \Omega_N \cup \partial \Omega_R].

In the following, we consider a manufactured solution stem:[u=x^2+y^2] and we would like to verify the a priori convergence finite element property.

CAUTION: This test case is tricky because the stem:[\partial \Omega] is curved and stem:[\partial \Omega \neq \partial \Omega_h]. Depending on the boundary condition type and in particular the definition of the normal, we may obtain the proper convergence rate or not.

We provide here the basic geometry used in Gmsh to describe stem:[\Omega].

.Description of the geometry in Gmsh
[source,cpp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/laplacian/circle-dirichlet.geo[tag=cad]
----

NOTE: The `Circle` curve has several sections (`1,2,3,5`) that will be used to define the different boundary conditions, Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin.

=== The case stem:[\partial \Omega=\partial \Omega_D]

We start with Dirichlet conditions on stem:[\partial \Omega] which means that stem:[\partial \Omega_N = \partial \Omega_R = \emptyset]. To this end, we mark all boundary sections (`1,2,3,5`) as `Dirichlet` as shown in the Gmsh geo file below

.Physical definition in Gmsh for stem:[\partial \Omega=\partial \Omega_D] in `circle-dirichlet.geo`
[source,cpp]
----
include::{examplesdir}/laplacian/circle/circle-dirichlet.geo[tag=physical]
----

The next step is to provide the proper conditions or expressions to {feelpp} application `feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d`. They are described in the `.cfg` file.



.Listing: expression section in the cfg file `circle-dirichlet.cfg`
[source,ini]
----
include::{examplesdir}/laplacian/circle/circle-dirichlet.cfg[tag=functions]
----

NOTE: In the Dirichlet case, we do not have the issue mentioned above regarding the definition of the boundary and in particular the unit exterior normal to the boundary. We require only a point-wise evaluation of the condition on the boundary which are numerically exact.


We are now ready to run the application.
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ cd {path-quickstart}/laplacian/circle
$ mpirun -np 4 feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d --config-file circle-dirichlet.cfg
----

This gives us some data such as solution of our problem or the mesh used in the application.
