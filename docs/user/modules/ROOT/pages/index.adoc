[[feelpp]]
== What is {feelpp}?


{feelpp} is a unified {cpp} implementation of Galerkin methods (finite and
spectral element methods) in 1D, 2D and 3D to solve partial differential
equations.

{feelpp} comprises three components:
{feelpp}:: the mathematical kernel libraries, applications and tools.
{feelpptb}:: the {feelpp} mono and multi-physics toolboxes to solve physic based problems
{feelppmor}:: the {feelpp} model order reduction applications, tools and models

Each component provides a Python interface to access that mimic the {cpp} counterpart.

=== {feelpp}

. a **versatile mathematical kernel** solving easily problems using
   different techniques thus allowing testing and comparing methods, e.g. cG versus dG.
. a *small* and *manageable* library which nevertheless encompasses a wide
  range of numerical methods and techniques and in particular reduced order
  methods such as the reduced basis method.
. a software that follows closely the mathematical abstractions
  associated with partial differential equations (PDE) and in
  particular the finite element mathematical framework and
  variational formulations.
. a library that offers solving strategies that scales up to
  thousands and even tens of thousands of cores.
. a library entirely in {cpp} allowing to create {cpp} complex and typically
  non-linear multi-physics applications currently in industry, physics and
  health-care.
. {pyfeelpp} to manipulate {feelpp} mathematical objects in {python} to solve PDE

=== {feelpptb}

{feelpptb} provides :

. libraries to manipulate physics based models and couple them
. a set of mono and multi-physics application readily available :
  * fluid mechanics
  * solid mechanics
  * heat transfer and conjuguate heat transfer 
  * fluid structure interaction
  * electro and magnetostatic
  * thermoelectric
  * levelset and multifluid
. {pyfeelpptb} which provides an interface to the different physical based models and reproduces the main toolbox applications in {python}.

=== {feelppmor}

{feelppmor} provides:

. tools to manipulate reduced order models
. examples of reduced order models
. {pyfeelppmor} to manipulate reduced order models in {python}


[[purpose]]
== What is the purpose of this manual ?


The purpose of this manual is to allow the {feelpp} user

* [x] get started with {feelpp} and its toolboxes using xref:user:using:docker.adoc[Docker] or xref:user:using:singularity.adoc[Singularity].
* [x] learn using {feelpp} and solving PDE in xref:user:cpp:index.adoc[{cpp}] and xref:user:python:index.adoc[{python}]

[[scope]]
== What is the scope of this manual?

We need to define first what is a {feelpp} user to define the scope.

{feelpp} User::
A {feelpp} user can be either
* an application-user who runs the applications provided by {feelpp} either via Docker or via an installation on a system or infrastructure.
* a dsel-user  who implements {cpp} code using {feelpp} Galerkin domain specific embdedded language, see _e.g._ xref:user:cpp:laplacian.adoc[Laplacian].
* a Python developer who uses {pyfeelpp} to solve PDEs.

This book discusses the {feelpp} user perspective.
This book does not discuss or present in-depth {feelpp} API or internal programming but rather present the principles and essential ingredients to get started.

[[target]]
== Who is this book for?

This book is for students, engineers, scientists and researchers who want to use {feelpp}:

* [x] solve PDEs using {feelpp} xref:toolboxes:ROOT:index.adoc[toolboxes];
* [x] solve PDEs using the embedded language for Galerkin methods;
* [x] more generally develop numerical methods in a framework readily available for high performance computing.

== Conventions


The following typographical conventions are used in the book

_Italic_ indicates new terms

`typewriter` is used on program listings as well as when referring to
programming elements, _e.g._ functions, variables, statements, data types,
environment variables or keywords.

`\$ typewriter` or `> typewriter` displays commands that the user types literally without the `\$` or `>`.

NOTE: this is a general note.

WARNING: this is a general warning.

CAUTION: be cautious

Hereafter, in the context of tutorial or the documentation of a specific process, four difficulty levels can be displayed:
