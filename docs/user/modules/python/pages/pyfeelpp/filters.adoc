= Exporting results for visualisation
include::{partialsdir}/header-macros.adoc[]

We now turn to the exporter facility of {feelpp} which allows to provide the results of {feelpp} solves in a format readable by {paraview} or {ensight}.

In this 2D and 3D example, we

* [x] download a mesh description from {uri-github-feelpp}
* [x] build the mesh and partition it
* [x] build a function space stem:[X_h]
* [x] create an element stem:[u] of stem:[X_h] which interpolate an expression givn by the end-user
* [x] export to the Ensight Gold format (the default {feelpp} format) of {feelpp}

.Example to build a mesh and function space, create an element and visualize them in {paraview}

To run this example,

[source,sh]
----
mpiexec -n 4 python3 test_exporter.py
----

The location of the results are shown in the output of the script.

It remains to open the file `.case` with {paraview} or {ensight}.

It should look like this
