= {feelpp} Coefficient Form PDE Toolboxes in Python
:page-jupyter: true

== Introduction

The toolbox  solves a coefficient form partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method. 
In coefficient form, the PDE is expressed as a linear combination of differential operators with coefficients that may vary spatially. 
The PDE is discretized using a finite element method, where the solution is approximated by a linear combination of basis functions defined on a mesh. The coefficients of the differential operators are also discretized on the mesh, in time and depend on parameters. 
The resulting system of linear equations is then solved to obtain the numerical solution. 


== what are coefficient form PDEs ?
