include::{partialsdir}/header-macros.adoc[]

NOTE: {lvl_advanced}

We present here the {feelpp} toolchain with both required and suggested tools to either compile {feelpp} or use with {feelpp}.

== Compilers

{feelpp} uses {cpp}17 compilers such as GCC8 and Clang (stem:[\geq 5]).

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is mandatory not only to have a {cpp}17 compiler but also {cpp} stantard library compatible with {cpp}17
We don't use yet {cpp}17 standard library features
====

.Table {cpp} compilers and standard libraries combinations
|===
| Compiler  | Minimal Version | Recommended Version | Standard Library
| {clangpp} | 6 | 9  | libstdc{plus}{plus} 7
| {clangpp}| 6 | 9 |  libc{plus}{plus} (corresponding clang version)
| {gpp}  | 8 | 9 | libstdc{plus}{plus} 7
|===

IMPORTANT: {clangpp} is the preferred compiler by far for {feelpp}, it compiles much faster and use far less memory than {gpp}

[NOTE]
====
A few applications are not built with GCC, GCC ICEs (Internal Compiler Error) on them.

.List of applications disabled with GCC
|===
| `feelpp_elasticity_pure_traction_{2d,3d}` | pure traction elasticity applications in `feelpp/quickstart`
| `feelpp_toolbox_hdg_*` | all toolbox HDG applications are disabled with GCC.

== Required tools and libraries

Other than {cpp}14 compilers, {feelpp} requires only a few tools and libraries, namely CMake, Boost C++ libraries and an MPI implementation such as open-mpi or mpich. The table below provides information regarding the minimum and maximum version supported. A -- means it has not necessarily been tested with the latest version but we do not expect any issues. Note that for MPI, an implementation with MPI-IO support would be best.
