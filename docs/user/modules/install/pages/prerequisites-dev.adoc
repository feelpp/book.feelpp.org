NOTE: {lvl_advanced}

We present here the {feelpp} toolchain with both required and suggested tools to either compile {feelpp} or use with {feelpp}.

== System Environments

{feelpp} is compiled and tested on various systems:

.Table of linux operating systems
|===
| Flavor | Version | Compiler | Notes
| Ubuntu | 20.04 | clang | Docker images and packages available
| Ubuntu | 22.04 | clang | Docker images and packages available
| Ubuntu | 22.10 | clang | Scheduled build once per week
| Debian | 11 | clang | Docker images and packages available
| Debian | testing | clang | Scheduled build once per week
| Debian | unstable | clang | Scheduled build once per week
| Fedora | 36 | clang | Scheduled build once per week
| Fedora | 37 | clang | Scheduled build once per week
|===


== Compilers

{feelpp} uses {cpp}17 compilers such as GCC8 and Clang (stem:[\geq 5]).

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is mandatory not only to have a {cpp}17 compiler but also {cpp} stantard library compatible with {cpp}17
We don't use yet {cpp}17 standard library features
====

.Table {cpp} compilers and standard libraries combinations
|===
| Compiler  | Minimal Version | Recommended Version | Standard Library
| {clangpp} | 6 | >= 9  | libstdc{plus}{plus} 7
| {clangpp}| 6 | >= 9 |  libc{plus}{plus} (corresponding clang version)
| {gpp}  | 8 | >=11  | libstdc{plus}{plus} 7
|===

IMPORTANT: {clangpp} is the preferred compiler by far for {feelpp}, it compiles much faster and use far less memory than {gpp}

[NOTE]
====
A few applications are not built with GCC, GCC ICEs (Internal Compiler Error) on them.

.List of applications disabled with GCC
|===
| `feelpp_elasticity_pure_traction_{2d,3d}` | pure traction elasticity applications in `feelpp/quickstart`
| `feelpp_toolbox_hdg_*` | all toolbox HDG applications are disabled with GCC.

== Required tools and libraries

Other than {cpp}17 compilers, {feelpp} requires only a few tools and libraries, namely CMake, Boost C++ libraries and an MPI implementation such as open-mpi or mpich. The table below provides information regarding the minimum and maximum version supported. A -- means it has not necessarily been tested with the latest version but we do not expect any issues. Note that for MPI, an implementation with MPI-IO support would be best.

.Table required tools to compile Feel++

| Name | Minimum Version | Recommended Version | Maximum Version | Notes

| link:https://cmake.org/[CMake] | 3.13.0 | >= 3.21 | -- |
| MPI   | -- | -- | -- | link:https://www.open-mpi.org/[OpenMPI] or link:https://www.mpich.org/[MPICH]
| link:https://www.boost.org/[Boost] | 1.61 | >= 1.70 | -- | Boost C++ libraries
| link:https://www.python.org/[Python Interpreter] |  3.8 | >= 3.8 | -- | Version 2 has never been tested

== Recommended libraries

Here is a list of libraries that we recommend to use jointly with Feel++.
