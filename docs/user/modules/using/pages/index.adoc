= Using {feelpp}

{feelpp} comes with applications and tools.

We discuss in this chapter how to use them, we start with some explanations of using {feelpp} in container systems

* [x] xref:user:using:singularity.adoc[Singularity] for HPC systems, clusters and supecomputers
* [x] xref:user:using:expr.adoc[Using mathematical expressions] in {feelpp} expressions

== Using {feelpp} tools

{feelpp} provides tools to manipulate data structures and Functional Mockup Unit(FMU) using the Functional Mockup Interface(FMI).
It allows to prepare them for numerical experiments or provide them for analysis before and after the experiments
