The most common type of strain gauge consists of an insulating flexible backing which supports a metallic foil pattern. The gauge is attached to the object by a suitable adhesive. As the object is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its electrical resistance to change. This resistance change, usually measured using a Wheatstone bridge, is related to the strain by the quantity known as the *gauge factor*.\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Running the case\n\n","## Command line\n\n","The command line to run this case is\n","```mpirun","mpirun -np 4 feelpp_toolbox_solid --case \"github:{repo:toolbox,path:examples/modules/csm/examples/sensor}\"","```","*Note:* The report of the execution of the command above is available .\n","## Python interface\n\n","We start with the {feelpp} environment.\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"fragment"}},"outputs":[],"source":["from feelpp import *\n","from feelpp.toolboxes.core import *\n","from feelpp.toolboxes.solid import *\n","\n","# create the application\n","# create a feelppdb subdirectory where the results are stored\n","app = Environment(['feelpp_toolbox_solid'], opts= toolboxes_options(\"solid\"),config=localRepository(\"\"))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Next we download the study configuration and simulate it\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"fragment"}},"outputs":[],"source":["sensorcfg=feelpp.download(\"github:{repo:toolbox,path:examples/modules/csm/examples/sensor/}\", worldComm=app.worldCommPtr())[0] # <1>\n","sensorcfg+='/sensor.cfg' # <2>\n","if os.path.exists(sensorcfg): # <3>\n","  app.setConfigFile(sensorcfg) # <4>\n","  s = solid(dim=3) # <5>\n","  # get displacement and von-mises measures from the model\n","  ok,meas=simulate(s) # <6>\n","  if ok:\n","    # export in paraview format\n","    s.exportResults() # <7>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data files\n\n","The case data files are available in Github [here](https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/blob/master/examples/modules/csm/examples/sensor/)\n","\n","- [CFG file](https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/blob/master/examples/modules/csm/examples/sensor/sensor.cfg) - [[Edit the file](https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/edit/master/examples/modules/csm/examples/sensor/sensor.cfg)]\n","- [JSON file](https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/blob/master/examples/modules/csm/examples/sensor/sensor.json) - [[Edit the file](https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/edit/master/examples/modules/csm/examples/sensor/sensor.json)]\n","\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Model/Geometry\n\n","The first step is to create the model of the object, which we can simply do in the Creo Parametric program.
